## 5. Output Location

```
.claude/orchestration/
 temp/           ← Working analysis files (clean up after)

## 6. Tips

1. **Provide data context** - Mention file paths, schemas, or paste sample data
2. **Be specific about output** - "Create a chart" vs "Generate insights"
3. **Use /plan for pipelines** - Multi-step analyses benefit from planning
4. **Check python-analytics-expert** - Best for pandas/numpy/matplotlib work
