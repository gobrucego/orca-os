## Active Commands (OS 2.1)

### Planning Commands

#### `/plan` - Unified Requirements + RA Blueprint
**NEW in OS 2.1 - Replaces 8+ commands**

- **Purpose:** Complete requirements gathering + Response Awareness planning
- **Usage:** `/plan "feature description"`
- **What it does:**

  - Blueprint generation at `requirements/<id>/06-requirements-spec.md`
- **Never implements** - only plans
- **Location:** `~/.claude/commands/plan.md`

**Example:**
```bash
/plan "Add user profile editing with avatar upload"

# Creates:
requirements/2025-11-24-1430-user-profile-editing/06-requirements-spec.md

# Then implement:
/orca-nextjs "Implement requirement 2025-11-24-1430-user-profile-editing using that spec"

## Deprecated Commands (Backward Compatible)

**Use `/plan` instead:**
- `/requirements-start` - Start requirements gathering
- `/requirements-status` - Continue requirements
- `/requirements-end` - Finalize requirements
- `/requirements-current` - View active requirement
- `/requirements-list` - List all requirements
- `/requirements-remind` - Remind of requirements rules

**Use `/plan` + `/orca-{domain}` instead:**
- `/response-awareness-plan` - RA planning
- `/response-awareness-implement` - RA implementation

**Note:** These commands still work but redirect to the new workflow.

---

## OS 2.1 Workflow Pattern

### Recommended Flow

```
1. PLANNING
   /plan "feature description"
   ↓
   Creates: requirements/<id>/06-requirements-spec.md

2. IMPLEMENTATION
   /orca-nextjs "implement requirement <id> using that spec"
   OR
   /orca-ios "implement requirement <id> using that spec"
   OR
   /orca-expo "implement requirement <id> using that spec"
   ↓
   Executes: Context → Team Confirm → Plan → Implement → Gates → Verify

3. META-AUDIT (periodically)
   /audit "last 10 tasks"
   ↓
   Creates: Standards from failures, learnings for future
```

### Old Workflow (Deprecated)
```
❌ /requirements-start → /requirements-status → /response-awareness-implement
```

### New Workflow (OS 2.1)
```
✅ /plan → /orca-{domain} → /audit
```

---

## Command Architecture

### Role Boundaries (NEW in OS 2.1)

**Orchestrators:**
- NEVER write code
- ONLY coordinate agents via Task tool
- Read phase_state.json to track progress
- Survive interruptions (questions, pauses, clarifications)

**Agents:**
- Specialized workers
- Write code, run tests, analyze
- Report back to orchestrator
- Never orchestrate themselves

**Enforcement:**
Every orca command includes:
```markdown
## 🚨 CRITICAL ROLE BOUNDARY 🚨

YOU ARE AN ORCHESTRATOR. YOU NEVER WRITE CODE.

If you find yourself about to use Edit/Write tools: STOP. You've broken role.
```

### Team Confirmation (NEW in OS 2.1)

Before any pipeline executes:
1. Orchestrator detects domain
2. Proposes agent team
3. Uses AskUserQuestion tool (interactive UI)
4. Waits for user confirmation/adjustment
5. Proceeds with approved team

**Benefits:**
- No surprise agent teams
- User controls scope
- Clear expectations

### State Preservation (NEW in OS 2.1)

Orchestrators maintain state across interruptions:
- Read `phase_state.json` after user input
- "DO NOT ABANDON THE PIPELINE" directive
- Resume at correct phase
- Delegate to appropriate agent

**Survives:**
- User questions
- Clarifications
- Test result reviews
- Pauses

### Phase Structure

```yaml
phase_1_context:
  agent: project-context-server
  mandatory: true

phase_2_team_confirmation:
  tool: AskUserQuestion
  mandatory: true

phase_3_planning:
  agent: grand-architect (Opus)
  context_required: true

phase_4_implementation:
  agent: builder (Sonnet)
  dependencies: [phase_3]

phase_5_gates:
  agents: [standards-enforcer, design-reviewer]
  gates:
    - standards: 90
    - design_qa: 90

phase_6_verification:
  agent: verification-agent
  evidence_required: true
```

### Context Integration

All OS 2.1 commands MUST:
1. Query ProjectContextServer first (mandatory)
2. Pass context to agents
3. Maintain context through phases
4. Update vibe.db with learnings
5. Read phase_state.json for resumption

### Quality Gates

Commands enforce:
- **Standards:** Minimum score 90/100
- **Design QA:** Minimum score 90/100 (UI work)
- **Accessibility:** Minimum score 90/100 (UI work)
- **Performance:** Budget compliance (mobile work)
- **Build/Test:** Must pass (all domains)

---

## Command Patterns

### Domain Detection
```
/orca "build a React component"  → /orca-nextjs
/orca "create iOS view"          → /orca-ios
/orca "add Expo navigation"      → /orca-expo
/orca "analyze user metrics"     → /orca-data
/orca "write about AI safety"    → /seo
```

### Phase Execution
```
START → Context Query → Team Confirm → Planning → Implementation → Gates → Verify → OUTPUT
```

### Error Handling
- Context failures → Block execution
- Agent failures → Retry with context
- Quality failures → Iterate or escalate
- Orchestrator role violations → Stop and delegate

---

## Examples

### Full Feature Implementation
```bash
# 1. Plan
/plan "Add dark mode support with user preference persistence"

# Output: requirements/2025-11-24-1500-dark-mode-support/06-requirements-spec.md

# 2. Implement
/orca-nextjs "Implement requirement 2025-11-24-1500-dark-mode-support using that spec"

# Executes:
- Context query
- Team confirmation (nextjs-grand-architect, nextjs-builder, etc.)
- Planning phase
- Implementation phase
- Standards gate (≥90)
- Design QA gate (≥90)
- Build verification
- Evidence capture

# 3. Later: Audit
/audit "last 5 tasks"

# Analyzes recent behavior, creates standards from failures
```

### Quick Task (No Planning)
```bash
# For trivial tasks, skip /plan
/orca-nextjs "Fix typo in homepage title"
```

### Domain-Specific
```bash
# iOS
/plan "Add biometric authentication"
/orca-ios "Implement requirement <id>"

# Expo
/plan "Add offline mode to mobile app"
/orca-expo "Implement requirement <id>"

# Data
/plan "Analyze Q4 sales trends"
/orca-data "Implement requirement <id>"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Orchestrator Started Coding Directly
**Problem:** Orchestrator used Edit/Write tools instead of delegating.
**Fix:** OS 2.1 role boundaries should prevent this. If it happens:
1. Check phase_state.json
2. Remind orchestrator of role
3. Report as bug (shouldn't happen in 2.1)

### Agent Team Not Confirmed
**Problem:** Pipeline started without team confirmation.
**Fix:** OS 2.1 mandates AskUserQuestion before execution. Should not skip.

### State Lost After Interruption
**Problem:** Orchestrator forgot what phase it was in.
**Fix:** OS 2.1 state preservation should prevent this:
1. Check phase_state.json exists
2. Orchestrator should read it automatically

### Quality Gate Failed
**Problem:** Standards gate score 85 (need ≥90).
**Fix:** Orchestrator delegates to standards-enforcer to fix issues, then re-runs gate.
