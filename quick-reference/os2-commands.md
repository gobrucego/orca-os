# OS 2.4 Commands Quick Reference

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-29
**Version:** OS 2.4.1

## What's New in OS 2.4

**Major Changes:**
-  **Three-tier routing** (default/tweak/complex) replaces simple/medium/complex
-  **Default now runs gates** - light path includes quality checks
-  **-tweak flag** for pure speed (skips gates, user verifies)
-  **--complex flag** for full pipeline (requires spec)
-  Unified `/plan` command (replaces 8+ requirements commands)
-  New `/audit` command (meta-review with Response Awareness)
-  Role boundary enforcement (orchestrators NEVER write code)
-  Team confirmation via AskUserQuestion (interactive UI)
-  State preservation across interruptions

**Deprecated Commands:**
- `/requirements-*` → Use `/plan`
- `/response-awareness-*` → Use `/plan` + `/orca-{domain}`

---

## Three-Tier Routing (OS 2.4)

All `/orca-*` commands support three execution modes:

| Mode | Flag | Path | Gates | Use Case |
|------|------|------|-------|----------|
| **Default** | (none) | Light + Gates | YES | Most work – fast with quality |
| **Tweak** | `-tweak` | Light (pure) | NO | Speed iteration, user verifies |
| **Complex** | `--complex` | Full pipeline | YES | Architecture, multi-file, specs |

### Examples

```bash
# Default: Light path WITH gates (most work)
/nextjs "fix button spacing"
/ios "add haptic feedback"

# Tweak: Light path WITHOUT gates (pure speed)
/nextjs -tweak "try different padding"
/ios -tweak "experiment with animation"

# Complex: Full pipeline WITH spec (architecture work)
/nextjs --complex "implement auth flow"
/ios --complex "implement offline sync"
```

### Gate Behavior by Mode

**Default Mode:**
- Light orchestrator handles execution
- Gates run after implementation (domain-specific)
- Scores must pass (≥90 for most)

**Tweak Mode:**
- Same light orchestrator
- Gates SKIPPED entirely
- User responsible for verification

**Complex Mode:**
- Full pipeline with grand-architect
- Spec REQUIRED (`.claude/requirements/<id>/06-requirements-spec.md`)
- All gates run with full verification

## Active Commands (OS 2.4)

### Planning Commands

#### `/plan` - Unified Requirements + RA Blueprint
**NEW in OS 2.2 - Replaces 8+ commands**

- **Purpose:** Complete requirements gathering + Response Awareness planning

## Deprecated Commands (Backward Compatible)

**Use `/plan` instead:**
- `/requirements-start` - Start requirements gathering
- `/requirements-status` - Continue requirements
- `/requirements-end` - Finalize requirements
- `/requirements-current` - View active requirement
- `/requirements-list` - List all requirements
- `/requirements-remind` - Remind of requirements rules

**Use `/plan` + `/orca-{domain}` instead:**
- `/response-awareness-plan` - RA planning
- `/response-awareness-implement` - RA implementation

**Note:** These commands still work but redirect to the new workflow.

## OS 2.4 Workflow Patterns

### Quick Tasks (Most Work)

```bash
# Default mode: Light path WITH quality gates
/nextjs "fix button spacing"
/ios "add haptic feedback"
/expo "update card styling"
/shopify "fix cart drawer"
```

### Rapid Iteration (-tweak)

```bash
# Tweak mode: Light path WITHOUT gates (you verify)
/nextjs -tweak "try different padding"
/ios -tweak "experiment with animation"
```

### Full Features (--complex or /plan)

```bash
# Complex work: Plan first, then full pipeline
/plan "implement user authentication"
/nextjs --complex "implement requirement <id>"

# Or explicitly request complex mode
/ios --complex "implement offline sync"
```

### Meta-Audit (Periodic)

```bash
/audit "last 10 tasks"
# Creates standards from failures, learnings for future
```

### Workflow Summary

```
 Quick fix      → /orca-{domain} "task"              → light + gates
 Exploration    → /orca-{domain} -tweak "task"       → light, no gates
 Features       → /plan → /orca-{domain} --complex   → full pipeline
 Review         → /audit "scope"                      → meta-analysis
```

### Old Workflow (Deprecated)
```
 /requirements-start → /requirements-status → /response-awareness-implement
```

## Command Architecture

### Role Boundaries (NEW in OS 2.2)

**Orchestrators:**
- NEVER write code
- ONLY coordinate agents via Task tool
- Read phase_state.json to track progress
- Survive interruptions (questions, pauses, clarifications)

**Agents:**
- Specialized workers
- Write code, run tests, analyze
- Report back to orchestrator
- Never orchestrate themselves

**Enforcement:**
Every orca command includes:
```markdown
##  CRITICAL ROLE BOUNDARY 

YOU ARE AN ORCHESTRATOR. YOU NEVER WRITE CODE.

If you find yourself about to use Edit/Write tools: STOP. You've broken role.
```

### Team Confirmation (NEW in OS 2.2)

Before any pipeline executes:
1. Orchestrator detects domain
2. Proposes agent team
3. Uses AskUserQuestion tool (interactive UI)
4. Waits for user confirmation/adjustment
5. Proceeds with approved team

**Benefits:**
- No surprise agent teams
- User controls scope
- Clear expectations

### State Preservation (NEW in OS 2.2)

Orchestrators maintain state across interruptions:
- Read `phase_state.json` after user input
- "DO NOT ABANDON THE PIPELINE" directive
- Resume at correct phase
- Delegate to appropriate agent

**Survives:**
- User questions
- Clarifications
- Test result reviews
- Pauses

### Phase Structure

```yaml
phase_1_context:
  agent: project-context-server
  mandatory: true

phase_2_team_confirmation:
  tool: AskUserQuestion
  mandatory: true

phase_3_planning:
  agent: grand-architect
  context_required: true

phase_4_implementation:
  agent: builder
  dependencies: [phase_3]

phase_5_gates:
  agents: [standards-enforcer, design-reviewer]
  gates:
    - standards: 90
    - design_qa: 90

phase_6_verification:
  agent: verification-agent
  evidence_required: true
```

### Context Integration

All OS 2.2 commands MUST:
1. Query ProjectContextServer first (mandatory)
2. Pass context to agents
3. Maintain context through phases
4. Update vibe.db with learnings
5. Read phase_state.json for resumption

### Quality Gates

Commands enforce:
- **Standards:** Minimum score 90/100
- **Design QA:** Minimum score 90/100 (UI work)
- **Accessibility:** Minimum score 90/100 (UI work)
- **Performance:** Budget compliance (mobile work)
- **Build/Test:** Must pass (all domains)

---

## Command Patterns

### Domain Detection
```
/orca "build a React component"  → /nextjs
/orca "create iOS view"          → /ios
/orca "add Expo navigation"      → /expo
/orca "analyze user metrics"     → /orca-data
/orca "write about AI safety"    → /seo
```

### Phase Execution
```
START → Context Query → Team Confirm → Planning → Implementation → Gates → Verify → OUTPUT
```

### Error Handling
- Context failures → Block execution
- Agent failures → Retry with context
- Quality failures → Iterate or escalate
- Orchestrator role violations → Stop and delegate

---

## Examples

### Full Feature Implementation
```bash
# 1. Plan
/plan "Add dark mode support with user preference persistence"

# Output: .claude/requirements/2025-11-24-1500-dark-mode-support/06-requirements-spec.md

# 2. Implement
/nextjs "Implement requirement 2025-11-24-1500-dark-mode-support using that spec"

# Executes:
- Context query
- Team confirmation (nextjs-grand-architect, nextjs-builder, etc.)
- Planning phase
- Implementation phase
- Standards gate (≥90)
- Design QA gate (≥90)
- Build verification
- Evidence capture

# 3. Later: Audit
/audit "last 5 tasks"

# Analyzes recent behavior, creates standards from failures
```

### Quick Task (No Planning)
```bash
# For trivial tasks, skip /plan
/nextjs "Fix typo in homepage title"
```

### Domain-Specific
```bash
# iOS
/plan "Add biometric authentication"
/ios "Implement requirement <id>"

# Expo
/plan "Add offline mode to mobile app"
/expo "Implement requirement <id>"

# Data
/plan "Analyze Q4 sales trends"
/orca-data "Implement requirement <id>"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Orchestrator Started Coding Directly
**Problem:** Orchestrator used Edit/Write tools instead of delegating.
**Fix:** OS 2.4 role boundaries should prevent this. If it happens:
1. Check phase_state.json
2. Remind orchestrator of role
3. Report as bug (shouldn't happen in 2.1)

### Agent Team Not Confirmed
**Problem:** Pipeline started without team confirmation.
**Fix:** OS 2.4 mandates AskUserQuestion before execution. Should not skip.

### State Lost After Interruption
**Problem:** Orchestrator forgot what phase it was in.
**Fix:** OS 2.4 state preservation should prevent this:
1. Check phase_state.json exists
2. Orchestrator should read it automatically

### Quality Gate Failed
**Problem:** Standards gate score 85 (need ≥90).
**Fix:** Orchestrator delegates to standards-enforcer to fix issues, then re-runs gate.
