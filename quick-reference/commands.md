/orca "Implement user authentication"
```

**What it does:**
1. Detects tech stack from keywords + project files
2. Proposes specialist team (6-15 agents)
3. Gets user confirmation (interactive, always)
4. Dispatches agents with chaos prevention (50 file limit)
5. Runs quality gates (0-5)
6. Captures evidence
7. Cleans up temp files

**When to use:** Complex, multi-domain work requiring multiple specialists

---

### /response-aware

**Purpose:** 6-phase evidence-based workflow (plan + implement + verify)

/response-aware "Add dark mode to dashboard"

# Plan only (review before code)
/response-aware -plan "iOS to React migration"

# Build from blueprint
/response-aware -build path/to/blueprint.md
```

**Phases:**
1. **Survey** — Map domains, integration points
2. **Parallel Planning** — Multiple planners propose paths
3. **Synthesis** — Create single blueprint, user approves
4. **Implementation** — Execute strictly from blueprint, tag assumptions
5. **Verification** — Resolve all tags via tests/build/screenshots
6. **Final Synthesis** — Summarize work, attach evidence

**When to use:** Features requiring planning → implementation → verification discipline

## Usage Patterns

### Full Feature Development

```bash
# Option 1: ORCA (multi-agent)
/orca "Build user authentication with OAuth"

# Option 2: Response Aware (6-phase)
/response-aware "Add dark mode to settings"
```

---

### Plan Then Build

```bash
# 1. Plan only
/response-aware -plan "Complex multi-step feature"

# 2. Review blueprint, approve

# 3. Build from blueprint
/response-aware -build .orchestration/blueprint.md
```

---

### UI Design Workflow

```bash
# 1. Design blueprint
/design-director "product detail page layout"

# 2. Implement (manual or via /orca)

# 3. Visual review
/visual-review http://localhost:3000

# 4. Design review (comprehensive)
/design-review
```

---

### Quick Iteration

```bash
# Small changes
/tweak "Fix button hover state"

# Visual check
/visual-smoke
```

---

### Memory-Driven Development

```bash
# Before starting
/memory-search "authentication patterns"

# After completing
/memory-learn
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Command

✓ **/orca** — Complex, multi-domain work
✓ **/response-aware** — Features requiring evidence
✓ **/design-director** — Layout design (blueprint-first)
✓ **/creative-strategist** — Strategic analysis (not implementation)

---

### 2. Plan Before Building (When Complex)

```bash
# Don't:
/orca "Massive multi-step migration"

# Do:
/response-aware -plan "Massive multi-step migration"
# Review blueprint
/response-aware -build blueprint.md
```

---

### 3. Use Memory System

```bash
# Always search first
/memory-search "relevant topic"

# Record after completing
/memory-learn
```

---

### 4. Verify UI Work

```bash
# Quick check
/visual-smoke

# Before merge
/design-review

# Iteration loop
/visual-iterate
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

```bash
Problem: "/command not found"
Solution:
1. Check ~/.claude/commands/ exists
2. Verify command-name.md file present
3. Restart Claude Code to reload commands
```

---

### ORCA File Limit

```bash
Problem: "❌ FILE LIMIT REACHED - Cannot proceed"
Solution:
1. Review .orchestration/implementation-log.md
2. Check for planning docs (should be banned)
3. Clean up /tmp/orca-session/
4. File limits: 2/task, 10/agent, 50/session
```

---

### Memory Search Returns Nothing

```bash
Problem: No results from /memory-search
Solution:
1. Check .claude/memory/workshop.db exists
2. Verify vibe-memory MCP configured
3. Add knowledge: workshop decision "your decision"
4. Rebuild index if needed
```
