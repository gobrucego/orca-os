# Vibe OS 2.3 – Architecture Overview

Vibe OS 2.3 is an orchestration layer for Claude Code.

It turns your `~/.claude` configuration into an operating system with:

- **Context** that is mandatory, not optional.
- **Memory** that persists across sessions.
- **Orchestration** that separates planning from implementation.
- **Specialist agents** instead of a single do‑everything assistant.
- **Gates and audits** that prevent “done” from meaning “compiles in my head”.

This document explains that architecture in layers, starting from the
default “just an agent and a repo” baseline.

---

## 1. The Default State – Why It Struggles

Most “agentic” setups look like this:

```text
          (1) Single agent does everything
                     |
                     v
+---------+        +-----------+
|  You    | -----> | LLM Agent |
+---------+        +-----------+
                        |
                        | (2) Ad-hoc context loading
                        v
                +---------------+
                |  Files / Repo |
                +---------------+
                        |
                        | (3) Tools used without structure
                        v
                 +-------------+
                 |   Tools     |
                 +-------------+
```

Where it fails:

1. **No persistent memory**
   - Every session starts fresh.
   - Architectural decisions get re‑litigated.

2. **No structural context**
   - The agent “discovers” the project anew every time by reading
     arbitrary files.

3. **No orchestration or role separation**
   - The same agent plans, implements, verifies, and self‑audits in one
     long stream.
   - Any interruption (“quick question?”) derails the plan.
   - Novice questions, architecture design, implementation, and
     production fixes all share the same prompt.

4. **No response awareness**
   - Assumptions, bias, and uncertainty are not surfaced or fed into
     gates.

Vibe OS 2.3 answers: “What if context, memory, and orchestration were
part of the architecture, not just the prompt?”

---

## 2. High‑Level Architecture

At a high level, Vibe OS 2.3 is defined first by its environment:
memory and context on your machine. Everything else – planning,
orchestration, agents, and workflows – is layered on top of that
baseline.

```text
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|               Memory and Context Environment                     |
|  - ProjectContextServer MCP → ContextBundle (single query)       |
|  - Workshop: decisions, standards, incidents                     |
|  - vibe.db: code index, history, optional local embeddings       |
|  - Context7 / external docs: framework and library knowledge     |
|  - All local → faster, cheaper, more consistent context          |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
                               |
                               v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|          Orchestration and Response-Aware Planning               |
|  - Uses ContextBundle + your goal to produce a plan artifact     |
|  - Chooses lanes, depth (light vs full vs audit), parallelism    |
|  - Drives pipelines but does not edit code directly              |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
                               |
                               v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Agents, Specialists, and Gates                   |
|  - Architects, builders, reviewers                               |
|  - Domain specialists (iOS, Next.js, Expo, Shopify, OS-Dev, ...) |
|  - Standards, design, and verification gates                     |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
                               |
                               v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Workflows and Interactions                       |
|  - Spec-driven features, deep audits, root-cause analysis        |
|  - Interactive questions and clarifications                      |
+------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
```

The rest of this document walks those layers in that order, starting
from the environment.

## 3. Memory and Context Layer

The memory and context layer is the baseline. Everything else sits on
top of it.

### 3.1 Components

- **Workshop** (`/project-memory`)
  - Human‑readable project memory:
    - Decisions (“We use SwiftData for new iOS persistence”).
    - Gotchas (“Shopify theme CSS must never use inline styles”).
    - Standards, notes, antipatterns.
  - Stored in `.claude/memory/workshop.db`.

- **vibe.db** (`/project-code`)
  - Code intelligence:
    - Chunked code (functions, classes, components).
    - Symbols for fast lookup.
    - Events and task history.
    - Optional embeddings for semantic search (via local models).
  - Stored in `.claude/memory/vibe.db`.

- **ProjectContextServer MCP**
  - Gateway that produces a `ContextBundle` for any task:
    - `relevantFiles`
    - `projectState`
    - `pastDecisions`
    - `relatedStandards`
    - `similarTasks`
    - `designSystem` (for frontend lanes)
  - Every orchestrator calls this once per task.

### 3.2 Memory Architecture Diagram

```text
          +------------------------------------------------------+
          |            ProjectContextServer (MCP)                |
          |  query_context / save_* / task_history tools        |
          +------------------+----------------+------------------+
                             |                |
              +--------------+--------------+ |
              |                             | |
              v                             v v
   +---------------------------+   +---------------------------+
   |  Workshop (session memory)|   |  vibe.db (code memory)    |
   |  .claude/memory/          |   |  .claude/memory/vibe.db   |
   |                           |   |                           |
   |  - decisions / standards  |   |  - code_chunks / symbols  |
   |  - notes / incidents      |   |  - task_history / events  |
   +---------------------------+   +---------------------------+
                                        |
                                        v
                              +-----------------------------+
                              |  Optional embeddings layer  |
                              |  (local semantic search)    |
                              +-----------------------------+
                                        |
                                        v
                              +-----------------------------+
                              |  Context7 / external docs   |
                              |  (framework & library info) |
                              +-----------------------------+
```

Key properties:

- **Context is mandatory** – No lane runs without calling
  `query_context` first.
- **Local first** – Workshop and `vibe.db` reduce how much code the
  model needs to read, and how often.
- **Embeddings are optional** – If present, they improve relevance;
  they do not change the architecture.

You interact directly with this layer via:

- `/project-memory` – managing Workshop and overall memory health.
- `/project-code` – indexing and searching code (and embeddings).

---

## 4. Planning and Response Awareness Layer

The planning layer is the bridge between raw context and orchestration.
It turns a `ContextBundle` and your goal into a stable, response‑aware
plan that everything else follows.

### 4.1 Response‑aware planning

```text
           +----------------------------------------+
           |    Memory and Context Environment     |
           |  (ContextBundle from ProjectContext)  |
           +-------------------------+--------------+
                                     |
                                     v
                       +-----------------------------+
                       |   Response-aware Planner    |
                       |   - interprets your goal    |
                       |   - uses ContextBundle      |
                       |   - surfaces risks & gaps   |
                       +-----------------------------+
                                     |
                                     v
                       +-----------------------------+
                       |        Plan Artifact        |
                       |   - phases and targets      |
                       |   - lane choices            |
                       |   - RA tags (assumptions,   |
                       |     risks, completion drive)|
                       +-----------------------------+
                                     |
                      +--------------+--------------+
                      |                             |
                      v                             v
            +---------------------+       +----------------------+
            | Lane orchestrators  |       | Verification & gates |
            | (/orca-*)           |       | (read RA + context)  |
            +---------------------+       +----------------------+
```

Because the plan is an explicit artifact (not just “thoughts in a
single reply”), orchestrators, builders, and gates all share the same
decisions and rationales without recomputing them or reloading the
entire project each time.

---

## 5. Orchestration and Pipelines Layer

On top of memory, context, and planning sits the orchestration layer. It
runs lane‑specific pipelines described by phase configs.

### 5.1 Lane‑specific orchestration

```text
                      +------------------------------+
                      |      Plan Artifact (RA)      |
                      +---------------+--------------+
                                      |
                          Lane selection, mode, depth
                                      |
                                      v
               +---------------------------------------------+
               |        Lane orchestrator (/orca-<lane>)     |
               +-----------+-----------+---------------------+
                           |           |
                           |           |
                  Light path           Full / audit pipeline
                (small, localized)     (multi-phase, gated)
                           |           |
                           v           v
                 +---------------+   +------------------------+
                 | Single builder|   | Parallel agent squads  |
                 | + quick checks|   |  architects, builders, |
                 +-------+-------+   |  specialists, gates    |
                         |           +-----------+------------+
                         |                       |
                         v                       v
              +-------------------+   +------------------------+
              | Minimal checks    |   | Verification & gates   |
              | (lint/tests)      |   | (standards, design,    |
              +-------------------+   |  tests, audits)        |
                                      +-----------+------------+
                                                  |
                                                  v
                                      +------------------------+
                                      | Learning and memory    |
                                      | save_* → Workshop,     |
                                      | vibe.db, task history  |
                                      +------------------------+
```

Each lane (iOS, Next.js, Expo, Shopify, OS‑Dev, data, SEO, …) has its
own phase config and set of agents, but they all follow this pattern:

- Start from a shared, response‑aware plan.
- Choose an appropriate mode (light change, full pipeline, deep audit).
- Delegate in parallel to builders, specialists, and gates.
- Feed results and standards back into memory for the next task.

---

## 6. Agents and Skills Layer

Below orchestration are the agents and skills. They are the workers of
the system.

### 6.1 Agent Roles

Across lanes, agent roles follow a common pattern:

```text
Grand Architect
    |
    v
Architect  -->  Builder  -->  Gates (standards, design, verification)
                    ^
                    |
              Specialists
```

- **Grand Architect (per lane)**
  - Holds the high‑level plan.
  - Coordinates phases and delegates to sub‑agents.
  - Never writes code.

- **Architect**
  - Performs requirements & impact analysis.
  - Chooses architecture and data strategies.
  - Writes a plan with RA tags (`#PATH_DECISION`, `#PATH_RATIONALE`).

- **Builder**
  - Implements according to the plan.
  - Produces code changes and RA events (`ra_events`).

- **Gates**
  - Standards enforcers check code against rules.
  - Design QA agents check design DNA and visual quality.
  - Verification agents run tests/builds.

- **Specialists**
  - Domain‑specific helpers (e.g. SwiftUI, Tailwind, Liquid, MCP
    config).
  - Called by builders or architects for narrow tasks.

### 6.2 Skills

Skills are structured knowledge packs:

- `nextjs-knowledge-skill` – Next.js architecture patterns.
- `ios-knowledge-skill` – iOS architecture and data patterns.
- `design-dna-skill` – design tokens and design system rules.
- `os-dev-knowledge-skill` – OS/Claude config patterns and safety.

Agents load skills as needed, not by default. This keeps prompts lean
while still enabling deep domain expertise when required.

---

## 7. Example Workflows

With the layers in place, we can now look at how they compose in
practice.

### 7.1 Spec‑Driven iOS Feature

Goal: add workspace sharing to the iOS app.

```text
You
  |
  | 1) /plan "Workspace sharing in iOS app"
  v
/plan
  |
  |  Creates requirements/<id>/06-requirements-spec.md
  v
  | 2) /orca "implement requirement <id>"
  v
/orca
  |
  |  Memory-first lookup (Workshop + vibe.db)
  |  ProjectContext query (domain: ios)
  |  Domain detection
  v
/orca-ios
  |
  |  Complexity classification (likely complex)
  |  Spec gating (requires spec)
  |  Team confirmation (AskUserQuestion)
  v
ios-grand-architect
  |
  |  Reads spec + ContextBundle
  |  Chooses architecture (SwiftUI vs existing patterns)
  |  Chooses data strategy (SwiftData/Core Data/GRDB)
  v
ios-architect  -->  ios-builder  -->  ios-standards-enforcer → ios-ui-reviewer → ios-verification
                       |
                       v
                   RA events
```

Outputs:

- Implementation with RA tags.
- Standards + UI gate scores.
- Verification results.
- Task history saved via ProjectContext and persisted to `vibe.db`.

### 7.2 Deep Next.js Audit (`--audit`)

Goal: audit the frontend architecture and design tokens without changing
code.

```text
/orca-nextjs --audit "audit frontend architecture, design tokens, a11y"
  |
  | Clarify focus (AskUserQuestion)
  | Memory-first search (Workshop + vibe.db)
  | ProjectContext diagnostic query (domain: nextjs)
  v
  Assemble audit squad via Task:
    - nextjs-standards-enforcer
    - nextjs-design-reviewer
    - nextjs-performance-specialist
    - nextjs-accessibility-specialist
    - nextjs-seo-specialist
  |
  | Agents run in audit mode:
  |   - Use Read/Grep/Glob + ContextBundle
  |   - No edits, only analysis
  v
Synthesize Next.js Audit Report
  |
  | Optional: save_task_history(domain: nextjs, task: "audit: frontend")
  v
Return report and suggested follow-up tasks
```

### 7.3 OS‑Dev Change (Configuring the OS Safely)

Goal: adjust OS 2.3 behavior (e.g., new lane, MCP config, or safety
defaults).

```text
/plan "Add backend lane for Go services"
  |
  v
/orca-os-dev "implement requirement <id>"
  |
  |  Complexity classification (likely complex)
  |  Memory-first context (Workshop + vibe.db)
  |  ProjectContext diagnostic query (domain: os-dev)
  v
os-dev-grand-architect
  |
  |  Ensures spec present
  |  Delegates to os-dev-architect for plan and constraints
  v
os-dev-architect
  |
  |  Plan:
  |    - which commands/agents/phase configs to touch
  |    - safety envelope
  |    - rollback strategy
  v
os-dev-builder  -->  os-dev-standards-enforcer  -->  os-dev-verification
                      |
                      v
                os-dev-standards.md
```

This ensures OS/Claude config changes go through the same kind of
spec‑gated, RA‑aware pipeline as application code, with dedicated
standards and verification.

## 8. Design Decisions and Novelty

Some of the key choices behind Vibe OS 2.3:

1. **Context and memory as first‑class architecture**
   - ProjectContextServer MCP, Workshop, and `vibe.db` form a shared
     memory layer that all lanes must use.
   - Context is not a suggestion; it is a structural requirement.

2. **Local‑first efficiency**
   - Code indexing and (optional) embeddings are done on your machine.
   - ProjectContext uses local search and `vibe.db` to pre‑chew context
     before the model sees anything.

3. **Pure orchestrators**
   - `/orca`, `/orca-<lane>`, `/orca-os-dev`, `/root-cause`,
     `/audit`:
     - Only coordinate; never edit code.
     - Use Task, AskUserQuestion, and MCP tools.
   - This separates planning and coordination from implementation and
     keeps plans stable across interruptions.

4. **Lane‑specific orchestration commands**
   - Each domain gets its own `/orca-<lane>`:
     - Encodes complexity rules (simple vs medium vs complex).
     - Enforces spec gating.
     - Provides audit and light modes.
   - This avoids one mega‑prompt trying to manage every domain at once.

5. **Deep specialist rosters**
   - Agents are narrow and domain‑specific:
     - SwiftUI vs UIKit specialists.
     - Tailwind vs Liquid vs MCP config specialists.
   - This encourages real delegation rather than expanding one
     generalist prompt.

6. **Integrated response awareness**
   - RA tags are written into phase_state and inspected at gates.
   - `/audit` and OS‑Dev can use RA events and violations to promote
     new standards over time.

7. **First‑class audit and diagnostic workflows**
   - Deep audit modes in each lane (`--audit`).
   - `/root-cause` to assemble lane‑specific diagnostic squads (e.g.,
     iOS testing + SPM config specialists) when things fail.

Taken together, these decisions turn Vibe OS 2.3 from “a pile of
prompts and agents” into a coherent, layered system:

- Memory and context as the foundation.
- Orchestration and pipelines as the control plane.
- Agents and skills as the workers.
- Audits and root‑cause workflows as the self‑reflection layer.
