# Log and File Locations - The Standard

**Purpose:** Define ONE standard for where logs and generated files go in projects.

---

## The Standard: Everything in `.orchestration/`

```
YOUR-PROJECT/
 .orchestration/                      # ALL logs and generated files
    verification/                    # verification-agent output
       ui-guard-report.md
       build-output.log
       ui-tests-output.log
       screenshot-*.png
       verification-report.md
   
    plans/                           # plan-synthesis-agent output
       SYNTHESIZED_PLAN.md
       CONFLICTS.md
   
    playbooks/                       # playbook-curator output
       signal-log.jsonl
       ios-patterns.json
       frontend-patterns.json
   
    completion-criteria/             # quality-validator definitions
       ios-app.json
       backend-api.json
   
    agent-skill-vectors/             # meta-orchestrator tracking
       skill-vectors.json
   
    implementation-log.md            # Implementation agents document work

 .claude/                             # ONLY Design DNA
    design-dna/
        projectname.json

 design-system.md                     # User creates (optional)
 design-system.html                   # Generated by viewer (optional)
 [your actual project code]
```

## What Goes Where

### `.orchestration/` - ALL Logs and Generated Files

**Purpose:** Single location for all orchestration-related output

**What belongs here:**
-  Verification reports (`verification-report.md`)
-  Implementation logs (`implementation-log.md`)
-  Build logs (`build-output.log`)
-  Test logs (`ui-tests-output.log`)
-  Screenshots (`screenshot-*.png`)
-  Plans (`SYNTHESIZED_PLAN.md`, `CONFLICTS.md`)
-  Playbooks (`ios-patterns.json`, `signal-log.jsonl`)
-  Completion criteria (`ios-app.json`)
-  Agent skill vectors (`skill-vectors.json`)

**What NEVER belongs here:**
-  Your actual project code
-  Design DNA (goes in `.claude/design-dna/`)
-  User-created documentation (e.g., `design-system.md`)

---

### `.claude/` - ONLY Design DNA

**Purpose:** Project-specific design constraints

**What belongs here:**
-  `.claude/design-dna/projectname.json` (design constraints)

**What NEVER belongs here:**
-  Logs
-  Verification reports
-  Implementation logs
-  Agents (they live in `~/.claude/agents/`)
-  Commands (they live in `~/.claude/commands/`)
-  Hooks (they live in `~/.claude/hooks/`)

---

### Main Directory - User-Created Files Only

**Purpose:** Your actual project

**What belongs here:**
-  Your source code
-  `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
-  `.gitignore`
-  `README.md`
-  `design-system.md` (if you create it)
-  `design-system.html` (generated by viewer)

**What NEVER belongs here:**
-  `implementation-log.md` → Should be in `.orchestration/`
-  `verification-report.md` → Should be in `.orchestration/verification/`
-  `*.log` files → Should be in `.orchestration/verification/`

---

### `docs/` - User Documentation Only

**Purpose:** Your project documentation

**What belongs here:**
-  `README.md`, `API.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (user-created)
-  `design-system.md` (if you put it here instead of main directory)

**What NEVER belongs here:**
-  `completion_drive_plans/` → Should be in `.orchestration/plans/`
-  Logs or verification reports → Should be in `.orchestration/`

---

## Agent Requirements

### Implementation Agents (backend-engineer, infrastructure-engineer, etc.)

**MUST create:**
```bash
.orchestration/implementation-log.md
```

**With all meta-cognitive tags:**
- `#FILE_CREATED: path/to/file.ts`
- `#FILE_MODIFIED: path/to/file.ts`
- `#COMPLETION_DRIVE: Assuming database configured`
- `#SCREENSHOT_CLAIMED: .orchestration/verification/screenshot.png`

**Before writing:**
```bash
mkdir -p .orchestration
```

---

### verification-agent

**MUST create:**
```bash
.orchestration/verification/verification-report.md
.orchestration/verification/ui-guard-report.md
.orchestration/verification/build-output.log
.orchestration/verification/ui-tests-output.log
.orchestration/verification/screenshot-*.png
```

**MUST read:**
```bash
.orchestration/implementation-log.md
```

---

### plan-synthesis-agent

**MUST create:**
```bash
.orchestration/plans/SYNTHESIZED_PLAN.md
.orchestration/plans/CONFLICTS.md
```

**MUST read:**
```bash
.orchestration/plans/frontend-plan.md
.orchestration/plans/backend-plan.md
.orchestration/plans/ios-plan.md
```

---

### playbook-curator

**MUST create/update:**
```bash
.orchestration/playbooks/signal-log.jsonl
.orchestration/playbooks/ios-patterns.json
.orchestration/playbooks/frontend-patterns.json
```

---

### quality-validator

**MUST read:**
```bash
.orchestration/verification/verification-report.md
.orchestration/completion-criteria/{task-type}.json
```

---

## Cleanup

**Use `/cleanup` command to remove orphaned files:**

```bash
# Files that get deleted:
./implementation-log.md                 # Should be in .orchestration/
./verification-report.md                # Should be in .orchestration/verification/
./docs/completion_drive_plans/          # Should be in .orchestration/plans/
./*.log                                 # Should be in .orchestration/verification/
```

**Run from your project:**
```bash
cd /Users/you/YOUR-PROJECT
# Then ask Claude: "Run /cleanup"
```

---

## Gitignore

**Add to your project's `.gitignore`:**

```gitignore
# Orchestration logs (optional - you may want to commit playbooks)
.orchestration/verification/
.orchestration/implementation-log.md

# Or ignore everything except playbooks:
.orchestration/*
!.orchestration/playbooks/
```

**Design DNA should be committed:**
```gitignore
# Do NOT ignore - this should be in git
# .claude/design-dna/
```

---

## Why This Matters

**Before standardization:**
- Logs everywhere: `./`, `./docs/`, `./.claude/`, random locations
- Cleanup required manual search
- Hard to gitignore consistently
- Confusing for users

**After standardization:**
- ALL logs in `.orchestration/`
- One gitignore line: `.orchestration/verification/`
- Easy cleanup: `rm -rf .orchestration/verification/`
- Clear separation: meta files vs. project files
