## 4. Pattern Extraction Summary

### From Cursor (→ All Builders)

```markdown
## Code Style Rules
- Never use 1-2 character variable names
- Functions = verbs, variables = nouns
- Guard clauses/early returns mandatory
- Max nesting: 2-3 levels
- Comments explain "why" not "how"

## Linter Rules
- Do NOT loop more than 3 times fixing linter errors
- On third failure, ask user for help

## Search Rules
- Semantic search is MAIN exploration tool
- Run multiple searches with different wording
- Broad queries first, then specific
```

### From Lovable (→ All Agents)

```markdown
## Common Pitfalls to AVOID
- READING CONTEXT FILES: Never read files already in context
- WRITING WITHOUT CONTEXT: Must read file before writing
- SEQUENTIAL TOOLS: Batch independent operations
- PREMATURE CODING: Don't code until explicitly asked
- OVERENGINEERING: No "nice-to-have" features
- SCOPE CREEP: Stay within explicit request
- MONOLITHIC FILES: <50 lines per component
```

### From V0 (→ Frontend Agents)

```markdown
## Design System Rules
- Maximum 3-5 colors total (count explicitly)
- Maximum 2 font families
- WCAG 4.5:1 contrast for normal text
- WCAG 3:1 contrast for large text
- Line-height 1.4-1.6 for body
- No font sizes <14px for body
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML with proper landmarks
```

### From Perplexity (→ Research Agents)

```markdown
## Report Format
- Minimum 10,000 words for comprehensive topics
- NEVER use bullet points or lists
- Flowing paragraphs only
- Minimum 5 main sections (## level)
- Citations inline: "statement[1][2]"
- No References section at end

## Planning Rules
- Break into multiple steps
- Assess sources for usefulness
- Verbalize plan for user to follow
- Review before writing
```

### From Codex (→ Data/Research Agents)

```markdown
## Citation Format
- File citations: F:src/main.rs†L21-L31
- Terminal citations: chunk_id†L1-L24
- Each test prefixed: , , or 

## Environment Rules
- Use ripgrep (`rg`), never `grep -R` or `ls -R`
- Run ALL programmatic checks from AGENTS.md
```

### From Devin (→ Orchestrators + Builders)

```markdown
## Planning Mode
- Always either "planning" or "standard" mode
- Planning: gather ALL info before acting
- Know ALL locations you will edit before starting

## Code Conventions
- Mimic existing code style exactly
- Use existing libraries and utilities
- NEVER assume a library is available
- Look at neighboring files for patterns
- Never modify tests unless explicitly asked
```

## 5. Agent Learning System Design

Based on Equilateral's STANDARDS methodology:

### Knowledge Structure

```json
// .claude/agent-knowledge/{agent}/patterns.json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "id": "pattern-001",
      "description": "Use Tailwind @apply for repeated utility patterns",
      "successRate": 0.92,
      "occurrences": 47,
      "lastUsed": "2025-11-28",
      "context": "CSS architecture",
      "status": "promoted"  // promoted (>85%), candidate, retired
    }
  ]
}
```

### Agent Lifecycle Hooks

1. **Before Task:** Read `.claude/agent-knowledge/{agent}/patterns.json`
2. **During Task:** Track pattern applications
3. **After Task:** Update patterns.json with outcome
4. **Promotion:** Patterns with >85% success over 10+ occurrences get promoted

### Integration Points

- Agents read knowledge at startup (add to prompt header)
- Agents write knowledge at completion (add to prompt footer)
- `/audit` reviews pattern effectiveness
- `/reflect` can manually promote/retire patterns

## 6. Risk Assessment

### `#PATH_DECISION` — Architecture Choices Made

1. **Hybrid pattern delivery** — Universal skills + inline lane-specific
2. **Learning persistence** — File-based JSON, not database
3. **No MDX format** — Keep existing Task tool syntax
4. **Playwright scope** — Next.js + Shopify, not Expo

### `#COMPLETION_DRIVE` — Assumptions Made

1. Assuming 400-600 lines is optimal agent size (based on V0 at 1,267 being overkill)
2. Assuming 85% success rate threshold for pattern promotion
3. Assuming agents can read/write to `.claude/agent-knowledge/` without MCP

### `#POISON_PATH` — Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't create 1,000+ line agents** — V0's 1,267 is exceptional, not target
2. **Don't duplicate patterns across 82 agents** — Use skills for universal patterns
3. **Don't add learning without metrics** — Must track success/failure
4. **Don't inline lane-specific patterns in skills** — Keeps skills focused

### `#CONTEXT_DEGRADED` — Areas Needing More Info

1. How exactly will agents read `.claude/agent-knowledge/` at startup?
2. How will learning interact with ProjectContext MCP?
3. What's the storage overhead of per-agent knowledge files?

## 7. Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1: Universal Skills
    ↓
Phase 2: Builder Agent Enrichment (depends on Phase 1 skills)
    ↓
Phase 3: Reviewer/Research Agent Enrichment
    ↓
Phase 4: Learning System (can run parallel to Phase 3)
```

### External Dependencies

- Playwright MCP must be configured for Shopify validation
- XcodeBuildMCP already available for iOS
- Context7 MCP available for library docs
