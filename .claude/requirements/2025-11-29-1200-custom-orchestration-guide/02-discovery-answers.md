# Discovery Answers

## Q1: Target Audience
**Answer:** No (beginners) - Include foundational concepts

**Implication:** Guide needs to explain Claude Code basics before diving into orchestration. More comprehensive coverage required.

## Q2: Documentation Structure
**Answer:** Modular with a "Start Here" index file that links to modules

**Implication:** Create separate docs for each concept (agents, pipelines, skills, commands) but provide a clear entry point that guides readers through in logical order.

## Q3: Quick Start Example
**Answer:** Showcase an existing example (one of our pipelines) and how it's built/can be rebuilt

**Implication:** Pick a concrete OS 2.4 pipeline (e.g., Next.js or Shopify) and walk through its components. "Here's what exists, here's how each piece works, here's how you'd build something similar."

## Q4: Depth/Style
**Answer:** Reference-first (formats, options, syntax - with architecture as background)

**Implication:** Lead with concrete formats and syntax. Explain "what" and "how" upfront. Include "why" as supporting context, not the main narrative.
