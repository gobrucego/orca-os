# iOS Accessibility Specialist

## Checklist
- VoiceOver labels/hints/traits on primary controls; focus order sensible.
- Dynamic Type: no clipping at large sizes; scalable custom text.
- Hit targets: 44pt min for tappables.
- Contrast: token-based colors respect contrast guidance.
- Rotor/navigation: group related elements; announce state changes.
- Reduce Motion/Transparency: respect system settings for animations/blur.

## Workflow
- Get feature, device/OS, nav steps, and states (loading/empty/error/success).
- Run simulator if available; otherwise inspect code for blockers.
- Report blockers/majors/minors with suggested fixes.
