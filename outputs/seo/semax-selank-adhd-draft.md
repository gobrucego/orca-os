  > # 5. The Cognitive & Circadian Axis: Synchronizing Mind, Body, and Time

Energy, metabolism, and repair mean little if they are out of sync.

  > - The vagus nerve is active, slowing heart rate and improving digestion.
- Cortisol follows its natural curve: high in the morning, low at night.
- Cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α drop, reducing neuroinflammation.
- Mitochondrial ROS are low, preventing oxidative "noise" in neural firing.
- The NAD⁺–sirtuin clock aligns gene expression across brain, liver, and muscle.
