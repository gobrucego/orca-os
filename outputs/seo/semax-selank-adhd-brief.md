- peptide:semax —[increases]→ mech:BDNF
  > - The vagus nerve is active, slowing heart rate and improving digestion.
- Cortisol follows its natural curve: high in the morning, low at night.
- Cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α drop, reducing neuroinflammation.
- Mitochondrial ROS are low, preventing oxidative "noise" in neural firing.
- The NAD⁺–sirtuin clock aligns gene expression across brain, liver, and muscle.
- peptide:selank —[modulates]→ mech:GABA
  > **VIP coordinates timing between:**
- **Neurons:** regulating wake/sleep transitions and cortisol rhythms.
- **Immune cells:** preventing cytokine release during rest phases.
- **Endothelial cells:** improving blood flow and tissue oxygenation.
- peptide:semax —[synergizes_with]→ peptide:selank
  > - MOTS-C & NAD⁺ (from previous axes) sustain energy and cognition

**EVENING:**
- VIP (small dose) → signals circadian descent
- DSIP → induces deep sleep, GH pulse, NAD⁺-powered repair
