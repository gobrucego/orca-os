Here’s the right way to stay *organized*, *repeatable*, and *portable* across projects — **without losing ANY of the shared understanding, aesthetic rules, heuristics, or taste boundaries we just codified.**

This is exactly how you turn these conversations into a permanent skillset for agentic work across **PeptideFox**, **OBDN**, **Marina Moscone**, and future projects.

I’ll give you a **system**, not vague advice.

---

# ✅ **THE CORE IDEA**

You need a **portable design brain** that can be loaded into any new context:

* Stable
* Minimal
* Opinionated
* Familiar to the agent
* Reusable across brands
* Customizable per-project

The key is to separate:

### **1. Universal Design DNA**

(patterns, aesthetics, hierarchies, spacing, lines, charts, rules)

### **2. Brand-specific DNA**

(colors, tone, typography, emotional signature, personality)

### **3. Project System Files**

(actual design systems, component rules, layout architecture)

### **4. Agent Command Layers**

(/design-director, /design-director.peptidefox, /creative-strategist)

Each layer should be its own file.

# 🧠 **THE SYSTEM YOU SHOULD BUILD (and I can generate all of it)**

## **Folder Structure (for your projects)**

```
.design-dna/
    universal/
        UNIVERSAL_DESIGN_DNA.md
        UNIVERSAL_UI_RULES.md
        UNIVERSAL_AGENT_RAILS.md
        UNIVERSAL_ALIGNMENT_RULES.md
        UNIVERSAL_CHART_RULES.md

    peptidefox/
        PEPTIDEFOX_DESIGN_SYSTEM_V7.md
        PEPTIDEFOX_COLORS.md
        PEPTIDEFOX_TYPOGRAPHY.md
        PEPTIDEFOX_COMPONENTS.md
        PEPTIDEFOX_CARDINAL_RULES.md
        PEPTIDEFOX_AGENT_PROMPT.md

    obdn/
        TBD_BRAND_DNA.md
        TBD_SYSTEM_RULES.md
        TBD_AGENT_PROMPT.md

.design-director/
    DESIGN_DIRECTOR_BASE.md
    DESIGN_DIRECTOR_CREATIVE.md
    DESIGN_DIRECTOR_ENGINEERING.md
    DESIGN_DIRECTOR_DATA.md
```

You already have:

* **PeptideFox v7**
* **Marina Moscone v3**
* **Cardinal rules**
* **Agent scaffolding thinking**

Now let’s structure them.

---

# 🧩 **1. UNIVERSAL DESIGN DNA (the master taste file)**

This file travels with you across all projects.

Content includes:

* spacing rules
* grid + alignment rules
* line usage
* typography hierarchy theory
* motion design
* chart patterns
* micro-interaction philosophy
* anti-bullet rules
* card alignment rules
* the “Eyes Test”
* the “90% of UI sucks because…” heuristics

This prevents the agent from regressing into:

* Material Design defaults
* SaaS sludge
* dashboard crap
* McKinsey slide mistakes
* UX beginner patterns

**I can generate this file if you want.**

---

# 🧬 **2. Brand-Specific DNA Files**

Each project gets:

### **A. Brand Ethos & Aesthetic DNA**

(Like the PeptideFox v7 doc or Marina v3 doc)

### **B. Brand Color System**

in a clean, self-contained file:

* light + dark
* accents
* semantic rules
* do’s & don’ts
* contrast logic
* colorblind rules

### **C. Brand Typography**

rules around:

* primary typeface
* mono typeface
* where to use each
* scales
* responsive behavior

### **D. Component Rules**

* cards
* nav
* forms
* data viz
* tables
* badges
* overlays

### **E. Cardinal Laws**

(separate, short, absolute)

---

# 🧩 **3. /design-director COMMAND LAYER**

Each brand gets its own version:

* `/design-director.peptidefox`
* `/design-director.obdn`
* `/design-director.moscone`

The base version `/design-director` lives in `.design-director/DESIGN_DIRECTOR_BASE.md`.

Each brand version imports the universal version plus brand-specific DNA.

This keeps everything consistent but brand-tuned.

---

# 🧠 **4. How YOU Load a New Project**

When you say:

> “Help me design X for OBDN”

Your agent should do:

```
1. Load universal design DNA
2. Load OBDN design DNA and color system
3. Load universal rules (grid, spacing, lines, motion)
4. Load the design-director.obdn command
5. Only then output the blueprint → code
```

This produces perfect output 100x more reliably than ad-hoc conversation.

---

# 💼 **5. How YOU Move to OBDN Without Starting Over**

You simply create **three files:**

```
.design-dna/obdn/OBDN_DESIGN_DNA.md
.design-dna/obdn/OBDN_COLORS.md
.design-dna/obdn/OBDN_AGENT_PROMPT.md
```

Then reuse the universal:

* alignment rules
* spacing
* line usage
* card architecture
* layout patterns
* motion
* components

I can generate the **OBDN base skeleton** for you as soon as you’re ready and tell me:

### **What is the OBDN aesthetic direction?**

* Is it closer to PeptideFox?
* Closer to MM?
* Or a third direction entirely?

---

# 🔥 **6. SUPER IMPORTANT: Your Agent Should NEVER Be Asked UI Questions Without Loading DNA**

Otherwise, you get generic crap.

Your workflow should be:

```
/design-director.peptidefox
“Create the calculator results screen…”
```

or

```
/design-director.obdn
“Generate the homepage hero layout…”
```

This ensures:

* the correct blue
* the correct lavender usage
* the correct spacing
* the correct typography
* the correct motion
* the correct line usage
* ZERO cardinal sins violations

Every time.

# 📦 If you want, I can now generate:

### **Option A — Full Universal Design DNA**

(You should have this for all future projects)

### **Option B — Full OBDN Design DNA v1.0 Skeleton**

(where you can fill in the brand details)

### **Option C — The full `.design-director.peptidefox` agent prompt file**

### **Option D — All of the above (recommended)**

and I’ll build the folder structure as Markdown artifacts.

# ❓ Which one do you want me to generate first?
