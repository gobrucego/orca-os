everyone is hyped about a Content
systems but let's be honest we don't
provide you real valuable assets that
you can use in your own business no se
optimization dual vocabulary and a
giberish make this content unusable
that's why I created my own content
system that tackles all these problems
and consistently generates articles like
these with SE optimized headlines and
content research done by various tool as
well as 5 to seven pages long articles
if you want to know more how I combine
air table as my content dashboard as
well as any1 for creating this system
like this using perplexity deep research
aval for competitors analysis chbt and
clo for Content writing and Rapid API
for SEO keywords stay tuned because in
this video I combine all the system and
show you how you can do it as well my
system consists of five different parts
part one will get the top three ranking
key articles for that particular keyword
part two it will generate summary and
outline for our content system agents
the third part will do a research using
different apis uh like perplexity and
SEO keyword research tools the part four
uh we'll be talking about how to write a
good brief for our agents that will
actually generate that content and in
the final part we be generating the
content editing it and summarizing into
one Google uh Google doc system starts
at air table and where we have our
content system dashboard we insert the
client URL the topic about we want to
write so in this case we'll be writing
about best year and platform 2025 we
select the type of a text in in this
case I selected blog post but we also
can use product review category
description landing page Etc we inserted
the language and the keyword that we
want to rank on CRM platforms our
competitors in this case it's spy drive
and some noes for AI to know so
basically that's the dashboard and in
the end we'll be getting the outline for
the text the content research done by
the AI the brief for different AI models
as well as the final result in the URL
so in order to test this forlow I just
need to go to air table and select send
and the wall process will start process
might took from 2 to 3 minutes because
we are a bunch of different API calls
so we'll need to wait and after
everything is finished I'll get back to
explaining on how this system really
works a couple of minutes with whole
system run through and now I can start
you explaining on how this actually work
and I'll start from a part one we'll be
talking about how to get top three
ranking links with content from Google
automatically with na10 the process
starts with a web hook so basically we
have a button field where we just label
it as send we the action is default open
URL and we just insert our web hook URL
select and and in input the record ID
with brackets and that's how we can
insert the record ID that we got from
the fa hook and now we have all this
information that we need like notes
keywords competitors type uh content
researches uh null because it still
wasn't generated at that time as well as
the topic lent URL and all this
information uh that information I like
to have in a separate pack in edit
Fields because after that I'll need to
modify it or something so I just
reduplicate this information like topic
type and language and insert it as
strings and now the fun part begins when
we are using tab HTTP request so if you
don't know what Tav is you can watch my
last video on sales enrichment agent but
basically Tav is a Google search API
that help us to get latest articles on
the topic on the keyword that we want to
have and research that content put that
content back to us for our AI to look at
it analyze it and adapt to the keyword
and the topic we want to write about so
basically we include the API out here so
you can go to appt.com and get your own
API key and it will help you
to H get all this information from
Google by inserting the query the search
Dev uh and all this time range stuff uh
that you might need in order to get the
the research uh in this case I just
inserted the Tav uh API key as well as
the query
that is our keyword CRM platforms and
basically the Tav will get us with free
top most ranking
results uh from Google with the content
and the URL as you see we get like a
Content description not the whole
content and that's it's a problem that's
why I want to get the URL of this
article and scrape all of it uh and I do
that
with code node that basically helps us
to extract a clean data URL the title
and the description in one place I used
chbt to generate this code so you can do
that true pretty easily and then we have
this clean data I Loop through each of
the Articles so we got three articles so
I Loop through each of them and I get
the full content of this article not
just a description but full content uh
for our analysis that we will make later
on and so basically I get content uh
HTTP request I just select get and I
don't select nothing else except v. a
API uh if you don't know what Jen AI is
is basically a very good almost free
scraping tool that you could use for
your own uh analyses and own large
language models that basically lets us
get more complete content just like this
from all these three different articles
and it is a needed information that
we'll be later analyzing and writing our
content
about uh and basically after each of
this is looped through we aggregate them
into one uh nice looking table with uh
with all this data that we got from each
of the article and now we'll be ready to
summarize it and create an outline out
out of this content so in the part two
we basically have a chbt model system
and user prompt so I can start with a
system PR insert the role with it's a
Content analyst and structure specialist
and basically it will provide us with a
output with a summary of that specific
article as well as the core main
insights that uh will be used for
further uh writing so adjacent format
summary and insights I I ask for it to
generate just like
that and the output uh looks pretty much
like this vertical provides uh this and
that at least 15 or 10 uh insights are
generate all the time and
the and that's a real valuable
information that we'll be using later on
to not just copy paste the article that
we got from the Google but to invoke a
real genuine content uh the user prompt
is way simpler I just say that you will
have the data of three best performing
articles and for context uh the topic is
this and that and please generate at
least 15 points using this aggregated
data so it will be using all the
aggregated data from these three
articles and based on the summary and
insights that we got uh we'll move on to
the outline part so basically this AI
part will generate us with an outline
for our blog post help understanding all
these different contents and the best
practices from last articles so in this
case we have a system prompt your
helpful intelligent writing assistant
the user prompt is also generated in a
pretty much similar format with a ro
objective and context so basically I
just include all very required
information for our outline and how we
should write I include some examples and
um things like that so it's a pretty
long prompt but it generates a really
good uh block uh outline thing because
with with a bad outline we cannot prompt
chbt or other AI notes to really write
those in a better way the research part
I think it's one of the most cool ones
because now we can have a possibility to
Deep dive into the content uh based on
the outline that we got so we'll be
using two different tools one will be a
perplexity research and the another one
is the keyword research where we
basically get even more content for our
AI agents later on as well as generating
some nice additional keywords that we
could also rank
to and we'll start with perplexity
research so basically uh This research
agent has two different tools one is for
perplexity and another one is for
keyword research so the research agent
itself its main task will be to provide
the report research report based on the
information it got from perplexity and
uh keyword research API uh for the
system for the task prompt I just insert
a bunch of information from that we got
already the outline the client
information and the task will be to
generate that report combining
perplexity and SEO analysis uh the
system prompt basically the same format
as always regarding the uh notes up here
we have perplexity and keyword research
so I'll show you what perplexity is all
about flow trigger that will input the
information from our uh research agent
so basically research agent will have a
sorry will have a input like this uh
latest trends statistics market analysis
of trm Platforms in
2025 uh including top layers etc etc so
it will be sent to our perplexity a API
we need to go to perplexity get the URL
include the authorization with a token
and insert the whole body template with
a model and Etc so basically we'll say
the most important part is uh the most
important part is the content part where
we say do a comprehensive market
research on this topic and we include
that Json query from the research
agent also replacing all the
uh unnecessary information that we have
right here and then that's it uh you we
can see the data that we had just uh
generated query was like this and we got
the content uh with the latest
developments in that particular field as
you see a lot of information and one
interesting part that we also get those
sitations so that's why I want to not
only send the information to our
research agent regarding the content
itself but as well as the citations for
further reference when we'll be dealing
with the writing itself so that's why I
included that edit Fields where I map
out the response uh that is the content
as well as the citations from which this
content was generated from and that's
basically it that's the perplexity agent
regarding the SEO keywords research that
that will be
that is also used by research agent we
are using uh SEO keyword research API
that I got from Rapid API so there are a
bunch of different apis out there uh for
this test I I'm not using any HF API or
samr API because we are costly but for
the client work we are implementing uh
this for sure and now I'm just testing
for this demo version I'm just using a
cheap API that I can
uh have a free trial on I selected the
SEO keyword research API that has a free
trial API uh basically needs only one
parameter the keyword that we are want
to rank uh to look for and the country
and the output of it uh is a very
interesting one I can quickly show
you so basically we get all the
different uh keywords related to the
same keyword word uh with a cost per
click search volume competition level
and the score so it's a useful
information and we get like 42 items in
this case like TM software examples
bestm programs serm bestm examples and
etc etc and this wonderful data can be
analyzed and our AI can look through it
and select the highest volume lowest
competition keywords for our own uh
article that we'll be using on include
several different keywords that rank
really good so basically if you want to
use this API it's a free free trial I
believe around 15 or 20 API calls every
week or month uh you'll need to go to
Rapid API uh subscribe to this API and
basically copy the Carl Command right
here and insert it into
the uh HTTP mode by importing the curl
just like this and importing it that
will be
it and yeah you'll get all this
different information that you need so
basically you can change the country the
keyword will be of course our Json query
C platforms from the a table you don't
even need to include your API key
because it will be up here so that's a
very good API call that will be analyzed
by our research agent and this research
agent will generate a report based on
these finding in more interesting review
we can go to air table and see the
content research brief in markdown
format so it's a comprehensive research
report the topic overview the market
rents and developments what are the
latest trends technology
advancements uh and Market leaders as
well as some good high volume
opportunities on the keyword side serum
platforms this one serum definition best
systems longtail keywords and content
Gap opportunities and all the different
sources that we might use it's a very
good side and now we can move to the
part four that is brief uh writing so
basically in this part our AI agents
will get those uh outlines the research
and will generate briefs for each of a
part in our blog post so one for
headline one for introduction one for
main content as well as the conclusion
uh so we are using brief
agent that has all this information
basically we we are saying that your
brief director orchestrating visa for
different sub uh sub agents uh and I
want you to Output the four different
briefs with each of your sub agents in
Json format so please include that Json
format we include the information from
for context um for context so all the
information about our client the outline
of a text uh and yeah we just repeat
that Json format and why we need that
Json format because we want to have a
separate briefs for introduction for
headline for main content and solution
so that's why I want to have uh four
different briefs regarding the sub
agents I did one interesting thing is
that I also included the research
analysis and outline for them
individually to because we need to
understand the context and if I wouldn't
use these um inputs basically the
headline brief uh the brief from the
brief agent to the headline brief agent
would be just generate me a headline
brief you know it wouldn't be very
complex or Advanced one uh and now we
have a bunch of information like from
the um research side as well as the
outline side like you know like this
because we already generated it so we
just put that information and uh fetch
it to the headline brief agent as well
as uh the rest uh so for one example we
can um see the headline brief grater
basically we input that information the
research analysis the outline and it
generates brief for the headline cre
store uh that include all the different
information we just uh insert the system
prompt that was created in the same
format or objective input and the output
format that I
prefer and when we have this uh brief we
repeat the same process with
introduction with main content brief
Creator as well as conclusion Creator
and now when we have all this different
uh J all these briefs we asked for the
brief agent to provide us with that Json
that's why I have a structure output
parser because I I saw that not every
time this agent generates a nice looking
Json so that's why I have autof fixing
output parser so basically that sees
that output and to really uh make sure
that we outputting that correctly so if
you don't want how to use it you could
just look for autof fixing parser and
select it at the brief agent level as
well by clicking the require specific
output uh
format so that's how uh this brief agent
uh really works of course it's very
difficult but I don't want to uh get
into two hours long video so that's why
I'm doing a short overview of this
system and moving on to the part five
that is like the most important part
because we are finally generating
content itself so basically we inputting
the uh all these briefs for introduction
for headline for main content and
conclusion writing agents we are using
Sonet 3.5 for Content writing uh
basically all of this system is running
on Sonet 3.5 uh brief agent creation
research agent content creation I only
use openi for summary outline and
editing just for testing purposes I
selected these models of course you can
uh uh use different models according to
the needs um based on my experience
Sonet is writing the best but I want to
try open editing as well the prompts for
the these different
agents and basically I just include a
bunch of different examples uh with the
context that we have already so I repeat
the same information like information
about the client the outline the
research the brief that you got and now
just write me a Content based on the
examples that we have and the uh
structure that I select so of course the
prompting in the content writing part is
like the most important part because you
need to good have a really good prompts
and examples for this aiio agents to
really work so I include the RO the
objectives and the SOP so basically the
information how this agent should write
the introduction in this example so it
will it should start with a hook with a
value brid with a Content road map so
basically uh to introduce the reader of
what we will be what the reader will see
at the end the table of
contents and the hook also include all
this information and context regarding
the SEO uh the Style Guidelines the
quality markers and Etc ET I include the
example restructure on how it should
write as well as some important uh parts
and basically after that I ask for it
and I give some
examples uh so I I include the example
of a blog post
introduction uh regarding the headline I
do the same I just in insert the
language guidelines I include some
examples and the context that it needs
to have as well as a long system prompt
regarding the structure and
formatting with the main content this
situation is a bit more different
because I wanted to really um get like
the most um most advanced results I can
possibly can have so basically I just
includeed uh us an AI in in this case PS
that basically says um write main
content section on the blog writing and
I just include some main content
sections generated on blog post so
that's how I kind of train with a agents
uh to write me in a better format so I
repeat this same uh process couple of
times for it to get like more uh
different uh examples on how you can
write based on information it has
already like SEO keywords research and
Etc and we finish with a conclusion tab
as well so that is like the main system
and after that we just go to the editor
agent that basically will look at the
end result that it got it got from our
conclusion from our main content and
headline and introduction and it will
edit it and see if it's really good if
it's a SEO optimized
and Etc so we include the uh conclusion
main content notes and the output of
this editor is to uh generate it to one
markdown format include the meta
description the title uh and
um to summarize and see if the SEO
keywords are really uh
working I included the maximum amount of
tokens for this and also I use uh 0.7 uh
uh temperature for all all of my agents
so that's uh pretty much it and the last
part is creating the Google documents
you already saw and updating the record
ID so regarding the Google Documents uh
I just uh first I create these documents
because you cannot just create and uh
create and insert that content uh with
one Google Docs node you need two
separate ones so at first I just create
my my node by selecting the title of it
and after that I'm update the same
document so basically I just need to
grab the doc ID from the cre docs node
and
I update the text and I insert the text
generated by the editor and that is uh
that the last part is to just update the
air table with
the information we just generated so in
this case the blog outline
uh how it looks
like opening block hook statement uh
table of contents cor content blocks Etc
uh we include the briefs that were
generated as well so create SEO optimize
headline content brief Etc the final
document is also generated right here so
we can see on the final document that
you got so uh for a moment I didn't find
a way how to include the markdown format
out automatically with n10 with make.com
it was pretty easy now I didn't see any
way or how to create this document uh
formatted
with uh Google Docs but it looks really
good it's pretty long and has a bunch of
different uh information and context so
pretty much it's the whole system uh
that we are using so we are using it our
own as well well and in the next couple
of weeks we are will be unboarding
couple of clients that will also would
like to have this system created for
them and yeah that's it I hope you
really liked this system and you will
implement this on your own business or
team if you want me to create the system
for you you can with me by pressing the
link in the description below feel free
to reach out to me and I really want to
help you I hope this uh system showed
you what's possible with with AI and
automation uh I will continue to provide
value with similar videos in the future
so uh stay tuned and see you soon
