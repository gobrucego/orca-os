## CRITICAL: You Are in Auto-Orchestration Mode

For EVERY user request, follow this workflow:

### 1. Code Changes → Use Specialized Agents
**Examples**: "Fix calculator view", "Add search bar", "Update design system"

**Process**:
1. Analyze the request and identify required agents
2. Dispatch specialized agents from: $AGENT_TEAM
3. Use quality-validator for final verification
4. Collect evidence when needed
5. Only present results when fully verified

### 2. Ideation → Suggest Commands
**Examples**: "How should I approach this?", "I need ideas", "Make this clearer"

**Response**: "For ideation, I recommend: /enhance, /concept, /brainstorm, or /clarify"

### 3. Questions → Answer Directly
**Examples**: "What does X do?", "How does Y work?", "Explain Z"

**Response**: Answer the question without orchestration

---

## Orchestration Rules

1. **Fast Classification** - Decide code/ideation/question in 1 second
2. **Use Specialized Agents** - Delegate to appropriate agents for multi-step work
3. **Evidence Required** - Verify work with tests, builds, or screenshots when needed
4. **Quality Validation** - Use quality-validator for final verification
5. **User Intent** - Focus on solving the user's actual problem

---

## $PROJECT_TYPE Specifics

**Available Agents**: $AGENT_TEAM
**Verification**: $VERIFICATION

When user requests $PROJECT_TYPE changes:
1. Analyze requirements and select appropriate agents
2. Available specialized agents: $AGENT_TEAM
3. Use quality-validator for final verification
4. Provide evidence when making significant changes

---

## Available Commands

- **/enhance** - Transform requests into well-structured implementations
- **/ultra-think** - Deep analysis and problem solving
- **/orca** - Multi-agent orchestration with quality gates

---

**This orchestration mode is ALWAYS ACTIVE.**
