# Quick Reference

## Slash Commands (Top)

- /finalize
  - Verifies completion via builds/tests/screenshots, design guard, atlas, and writes `.verified`.
  - Run: `bash scripts/finalize.sh`
  - Prototype profile: `FINALIZE_PROFILE=prototype bash scripts/finalize.sh`
- /ultra-think
  - Deep analysis and architectural reasoning (no code changes).
  - See: `commands/ultra-think.md`
- /enhance
  - Transform vague requests into structured implementation plans and TODOs.
  - See: `commands/enhance.md`
- /concept
  - Design brainstorming from references/screenshots.
  - See: `commands/concept.md`
- /visual-review
  - Multi-device screenshots + visual analysis (where available).
  - See: `commands/visual-review.md`
- /orca
  - Multi-agent orchestration (use sparingly; Start-Simple is default).
  - See: `commands/orca.md`

## Workflows

- Tweak Mode (fast loop, no screenshots)
  - Confirm changes: `bash scripts/design-tweak.sh run` (runs quick-confirm)
  - Toggle guard: `bash scripts/design-tweak.sh guard off|warn`
  - Set verify mode: `bash scripts/verification-mode.sh tweak|off|strict`
- Evidence Close-Out (Prototype)
  - Run finalize with lighter threshold: `FINALIZE_PROFILE=prototype bash scripts/finalize.sh`
  - Outputs: `.verified`, verification + design guard reports, refreshes atlas
- Full Strict Close-Out
  - Ensure `.orchestration/implementation-log.md` has tags, add screenshots if visual
  - `bash scripts/finalize.sh` (strict)
- Find and Map
  - Selectors/tokens to file:line: `python3 scripts/find-ui-refs.py "bento-card"`
  - Generate Design Atlas: `python3 scripts/generate-design-atlas.py`

## Verification Modes (Hook-Aware)

- strict (default) → require `.verified`
- tweak → accept `.tweak_verified`
- off → bypass verification (trusted sprints)
- Set via: `bash scripts/verification-mode.sh [strict|tweak|off]`
- One-off bypass: `VERIFY_BYPASS=1 git commit ...` or `GIT_VERIFY=off git commit ...`
