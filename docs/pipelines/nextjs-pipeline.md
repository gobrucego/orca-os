# Nextjs Domain Pipeline

**Status:** OS 2.4 Core Pipeline
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27

## Overview

The Nextjs pipeline handles **frontend/web development work** for Next.js apps. It is CSS-agnostic and adapts to the project's styling approach (semantic CSS, Tailwind, CSS Modules, etc.). It combines:

- OS 2.4 primitives (ProjectContextServer, phase_state.json, vibe.db, Workshop, constraint framework)
- Memory-first context (Workshop + vibe.db before ProjectContext)
- Three-tier routing (Default/Tweak/Complex with default running gates)
- Spec gating (complex tasks require requirements spec)
- Response Awareness tagging (RA tags surface assumptions and decisions as instrumentation)
- Design DNA/token enforcement for all UI work
- Full pipeline agents (`nextjs-grand-architect`, `nextjs-architect`, `nextjs-layout-analyzer`, `nextjs-builder`, `nextjs-standards-enforcer`, `nextjs-design-reviewer`, `nextjs-verification-agent`)

**Core Principles:**
1. Context is MANDATORY - No work without ContextBundle
2. Design-DNA is law - No inline styles, only tokens
3. Edit, never rewrite - Respect existing code
4. Gates are strict - Must pass ≥90 scores
5. Maximum 2 implementation passes

**Orchestration:**
- Nextjs work SHOULD be run via the `/nextjs` command.
- Phase state is tracked in `.claude/orchestration/phase_state.json` using the contract in `docs/reference/phase-configs/nextjs-phase-config.yaml`.
- The high-level phases in this doc map to the more detailed `phase_state` entries:
  - "Planning & Spec" ↔ `requirements_impact` + `planning`
  - "Analysis" ↔ `analysis`
  - "Implementation - Pass 1 / Pass 2" ↔ `implementation_pass1` / `implementation_pass2`
  - "Gate Checks" ↔ `gates`
  - "Verification" ↔ `verification`
  - "Completion" ↔ `completion`

---

## Three-Tier Routing (OS 2.4)

The Next.js pipeline uses three-tier routing (see `docs/concepts/complexity-routing.md` for details):

| Mode | Flag | Path | Gates | Use Case |
|------|------|------|-------|----------|
| **Default** | (none) | Light + Gates | YES | Most work – fast with quality |
| **Tweak** | `-tweak` | Light (pure) | NO | Speed iteration, user verifies |
| **Complex** | `--complex` | Full pipeline | YES | Architecture, multi-file, specs |

### Default Mode (Light + Gates)

Most tasks take this path. Fast execution with automated quality checks.

```bash
/nextjs "fix button spacing"        # → light orchestrator → builder → gates
/nextjs "update header text"        # → light orchestrator → builder → gates
```

**Gates run:** `nextjs-standards-enforcer` + `nextjs-design-reviewer`

### Tweak Mode (`-tweak`)

Pure speed path. User explicitly accepts responsibility for verification.

```bash
/nextjs -tweak "fix padding"        # → light orchestrator → builder → done
```

### Complex Mode (`--complex`)

Full pipeline with grand-architect planning. Spec required.

```bash
/nextjs --complex "implement checkout flow"   # → full pipeline
/nextjs "build multi-page auth"               # Auto-routes to --complex
```

| Tier | Files | Spec Required | Example |
|------|-------|---------------|---------|
| Default | 1-5 | No | Fix spacing, change text, add icon |
| Tweak | 1-3 | No | Rapid iteration, exploring options |
| Complex | 5+ | **Required** | Multi-page flow, auth UI, SEO-critical |

### CSS Architecture Refactor Mode (OS 2.4)

Some Next.js tasks are **structural CSS/layout refactors** rather than simple tweaks:

- Cleaning up tangled CSS Modules or global styles
- Migrating inline styles/utility classes to semantic CSS with design tokens
- Consolidating duplicated layout logic across components/pages
- Implementing proper @layer structure

These tasks run under `--complex` but use a **CSS refactor sub-mode**:

- The orchestrator explicitly classifies the task as a CSS/layout refactor (via `/nextjs --complex ...` + clarification).
- `nextjs-builder` is allowed to perform **targeted rewrites** of style/layout layers (CSS, module CSS, layout components) instead of strict edit-only changes.
- A dedicated **CSS Architecture Gate** (`nextjs-css-architecture-gate`) runs after implementation to check structural quality:
  - Global CSS minimized or reduced where planned
  - All values use design tokens (CSS custom properties)
  - Proper @layer declarations for cascade management
  - Semantic class naming (page-prefixed: `.home-*`, `.pricing-*`)
  - Duplicated layout/styles consolidated into shared components
  - No inline styles or utility classes (unless project uses utility-first approach)

If the CSS Architecture Gate fails, the task cannot be marked complete even if token/visual gates pass.

---

## Standards Inputs (OS 2.4 Learning Loop)

Standards flow into and out of the Next.js pipeline:

### Input Sources

1. **ContextBundle.relatedStandards** (from ProjectContext/vibe.db)
   - Next.js-specific standards saved from past tasks
   - Architecture decisions and patterns
   - Gotchas and anti-patterns

2. **Workshop.gotchas** (from session memory)
   - Recent gotchas tagged with "nextjs"
   - Decisions with reasoning

3. **/audit-derived standards** (from past audits)
   - Standards created via `mcp__project-context__save_standard`
   - Pattern: "What happened → Cost → Rule"

### Gate Enforcement

`nextjs-standards-enforcer` MUST:
- Read `relatedStandards` from ContextBundle
- Treat them as **enforceable rules**, not suggestions
- Tag violations to the specific standard they break
- This enables `/audit` to track "standard X keeps being violated"

### Output (Learning Loop Closure)

After task completion:
1. Recurring violations → `mcp__project-context__save_standard` (via /audit)
2. New standards flow into future `relatedStandards`
3. Future tasks see and enforce the new standard

```
violation → /audit → save_standard → vibe.db → future relatedStandards → gate enforcement
```

---

## Phase Definitions

### Phase 1: Context Query (MANDATORY)

**Agent:** ProjectContextServer (MCP tool)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "domain": "nextjs",
  "task": "<user request>",
  "projectPath": "<cwd>",
  "maxFiles": 10,
  "includeHistory": true
}
```

**Output:** ContextBundle containing:
- `relevantFiles`: Files semantically related to task
- `projectState`: Current component structure
- `pastDecisions`: Previous frontend decisions
- `relatedStandards`: Nextjs standards from memory (workshop/vibe)
- `similarTasks`: Historical frontend task outcomes
- `designSystem`: design-dna.json + design system context

**Success Criteria:**
- ContextBundle received
- ≥3 relevant files found OR project structure loaded
- Design system context loaded (if exists)

**Artifacts:**
- Store ContextBundle in phase_state.json
- Log context query in vibe.db events

---

### Phase 2: Planning & Spec

**Agent:** `nextjs-architect` (via `/orca` and `nextjs-grand-architect`)

**Input:**
- User request
- ContextBundle from Phase 1

**Tasks:**
1. Understand request scope
2. Identify affected components (from ContextBundle.relevantFiles)
3. Check past decisions for similar work
4. Apply related standards
5. Create minimal spec (if needed for complex work)

**Output:**
- Clear understanding of:
  - What components need editing
  - What design tokens apply
  - What constraints exist (from standards)
  - Estimated complexity (simple/medium/complex)

**Success Criteria:**
- Scope is clear
- Components identified
- No ambiguity requiring user clarification

**Artifacts:**
- Update phase_state.json with planning notes
- Create spec file (only if complex): `.claude/orchestration/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`

---

### GATE: Customization Gate

**Purpose:** Block implementation if customization/theming needs are detected

**Checks:**
1. Does request mention "custom colors/fonts/spacing"?
2. Does request require new design tokens?
3. Does request need new component variants?

**If YES to any:**
- BLOCK progression
- Require design system update first
- Update design-dna.json before implementation

**If NO:**
- ALLOW progression to Analysis phase

**Rationale:** Prevent inline styles by catching customization needs early

---

### Phase 3: Analysis

**Agent:** `nextjs-layout-analyzer`

**Input:**
- User request
- ContextBundle
- Planning output

**Tasks:**
1. Read all relevant files (from ContextBundle.relevantFiles)
2. Analyze component structure and dependencies
3. Identify spacing/layout patterns
4. Map design tokens being used
5. Generate dependency map
6. Create implementation guidance

Optional (for image/mockup-driven work):
- When screenshots or mockups are provided, the `visual-layout-analyzer`
  agent may also be used to produce a `visual_layout_tree`,
  `detected_components` (including bento patterns), and `token_candidates`
  that align with `design-dna.json`. These artifacts can be referenced in
  planning, analysis, and downstream design/implementation phases.

**Output:**
- Dependency map (what affects what)
- Current design token usage
- Root-cause hypotheses for bugs (if bug fix)
- Safe change recommendations

**Success Criteria:**
- All relevant components read
- Dependency map complete
- Clear implementation guidance

**Artifacts:**
- Analysis report: `.claude/orchestration/temp/analysis-TIMESTAMP.md`
- Update phase_state.json with findings

---

### Phase 4: Implementation - Pass 1

**Agent:** `nextjs-builder`

**Input:**
- User request
- ContextBundle
- Analysis report from Phase 3
- Design-DNA from ContextBundle.designSystem

**Constraints (HARD):**
1. **Use design-dna.json tokens exclusively** - No inline styles
2. **Edit existing components** - Never rewrite  
   - **Exception:** In CSS Architecture Refactor Mode, targeted rewrites of style/layout layers (CSS modules, layout wrappers) are allowed when explicitly in scope.
3. **Compose with primitives** - Use shadcn/ui + project components
4. **Minimal changes only** - Scope strictly to request (or refactor scope)
5. **Verification required** - Run lint/typecheck after changes

**Tasks:**
1. Load design-dna.json tokens
2. Read target components (from analysis)
3. Make minimal, safe edits
4. Use only design system tokens/classes
5. Run verification (lint, typecheck)
6. Document what changed and why

**Output:**
- Code changes (via Edit/MultiEdit tools)
- Verification results (lint/typecheck output)
- Change summary

**Success Criteria:**
- Files edited (not rewritten)
- Lint passes
- Typecheck passes
- Only design system tokens used

**Artifacts:**
- Modified files (tracked via git)
- Implementation log: `.claude/orchestration/temp/implementation-TIMESTAMP.md`
- Update phase_state.json: files_modified, changes_summary

**Limits:**
- Maximum 2 files edited (for simple tasks)
- Maximum 5 files edited (for medium tasks)
- Maximum 10 files edited (for complex tasks)

---

### Phase 5: Gate Checks (Standards, Design QA, CSS Architecture – Parallel Group)

After Implementation Pass 1, the pipeline runs code-level standards and visual
design checks as a **parallel gate group**. All gates read from the same
ContextBundle and modified files; they do not modify code. In CSS refactor mode,
an additional **CSS Architecture Gate** runs as well.

#### 5a. Standards Enforcement

**Agent:** `nextjs-standards-enforcer`

**Input:**
- Files modified in Phase 4
- ContextBundle.relatedStandards
- design-dna.json

**Tasks:**
1. Read all modified files
2. Check for standards violations:
   - Inline styles (FORBIDDEN)
   - Non-token values (FORBIDDEN)
   - Component rewrites (FORBIDDEN)
   - Spacing not from scale (FORBIDDEN)
   - Typography not from scale (FORBIDDEN)
3. Check design-dna cardinal rules
4. Compute Standards Score (0-100)
5. Generate violations report

**Scoring:**
- Start at 100
- -20 per inline style
- -15 per non-token value
- -30 per component rewrite
- -10 per spacing violation
- -10 per typography violation
- -5 per other violation

**Output:**
- Standards Score (0-100)
- Gate label: PASS (≥90), CAUTION (70-89), FAIL (<70)
- Violations list with locations and fixes

**Success Criteria:**
- All modified files checked
- Score calculated
- Violations documented

**Artifacts:**
- Standards report: `.claude/orchestration/evidence/standards-TIMESTAMP.md`
- Update phase_state.json: standards_score, violations

#### 5b. Design QA

**Agent:** `nextjs-design-reviewer`

**Input:**
- Files modified in Phase 4
- ContextBundle.designSystem
- design-dna.json

**Tasks:**
1. Analyze visual implementation
2. Check design system compliance:
   - Spacing follows scale
   - Typography follows scale
   - Colors are from palette
   - Components use proper variants
3. Check optical alignment (not just geometric)
4. Check responsive behavior (if applicable)
5. Compute Design QA Score (0-100)
6. Generate visual issues report

**Scoring:**
- Start at 100
- -15 per spacing hierarchy issue
- -10 per typography hierarchy issue
- -20 per color palette violation
- -10 per optical alignment issue
- -5 per responsive issue

**Output:**
- Design QA Score (0-100)
- Gate label: PASS (≥90), CAUTION (70-89), FAIL (<70)
- Visual issues list with locations and fixes

**Success Criteria:**
- Visual analysis complete
- Score calculated
- Issues documented

**Artifacts:**
- Design QA report: `.claude/orchestration/evidence/design-review-<slug>.md`
  - MUST include coverage declaration, measurements (with explicit `px`
    values), pixel comparison, and a verification result section.
- Update phase_state.json:
  - `design_score`
  - `visual_issues`
  - `gate_decision`
  - `evidence_paths`: array of evidence file paths (e.g.
    `.claude/orchestration/evidence/design-review-pricing-page.md`)

> NOTE: The gate enforcement hook (`hooks/gate-enforcement.sh`) will block
> any attempt to set `gate_decision: "PASS"` for the design_qa gate
> unless:
> - `evidence_paths` is present and non-empty, and
> - Each referenced file exists and passes structural validation
>   (required sections and pixel measurements).

#### 5c. CSS Architecture (Refactor Mode Only)

**Agent:** `nextjs-css-architecture-gate`

**Input:**
- Files modified in Phase 4
- Layout analysis outputs (layout_structure, style_sources)

**Tasks:**
1. Analyze CSS/layout structure for the refactored area
2. Check structural criteria defined in planning, such as:
   - Reduction of ad-hoc global CSS
   - Consolidation of duplicated layout/styles
   - Design token usage for all values
   - Proper @layer structure and semantic class naming
3. Flag any remaining architectural smells or partial migrations
4. Produce a CSS Architecture Score (0-100) and recommendations

**Output:**
- CSS Architecture Score (0-100)
- Gate label: PASS / CAUTION / FAIL
- Structural issues list with locations and suggested fixes

**Artifacts:**
- CSS Architecture report: `.claude/orchestration/evidence/css-architecture-TIMESTAMP.md`
- Update phase_state.json: css_architecture_score, css_issues

---

### GATE: Standards Gate

**Threshold:** Standards Score ≥ 90

**If PASS:**
- Proceed to Design QA Gate check

**If FAIL:**
- If this is Pass 1 → Allow ONE corrective implementation pass (Phase 4b)
- If this is Pass 2 → Block and report "Standards not met after 2 passes"
- Record violations in vibe.db as standards
- Update phase_state.json: gates_failed

---

### GATE: Design QA Gate

**Threshold:** Design QA Score ≥ 90

**If PASS (and Standards Gate also passed):**
- Proceed to Verification phase

**If FAIL:**
- If this is Pass 1 → Allow ONE corrective implementation pass (Phase 4b)
- If this is Pass 2 → Block and report "Design QA not met after 2 passes"
- Record issues in vibe.db as standards
- Update phase_state.json: gates_failed

---

### Phase 4b: Implementation - Pass 2 (Corrective)

**Agent:** `nextjs-builder`

**Input:**
- Original request
- ContextBundle
- Standards violations from Phase 5
- Design QA issues from Phase 6

**Constraints:**
- ALL constraints from Phase 4 still apply
- **FOCUS ONLY on fixing violations/issues**
- Do NOT expand scope
- Do NOT introduce new changes

**Tasks:**
1. Read violations and issues
2. Fix each violation systematically
3. Fix each design issue systematically
4. Run verification (lint, typecheck)
5. Document fixes

**Output:**
- Code fixes (via Edit tools)
- Verification results
- Fixes summary

**Success Criteria:**
- All violations addressed
- All design issues addressed
- Lint passes
- Typecheck passes

**Artifacts:**
- Modified files (tracked via git)
- Fixes log: `.claude/orchestration/temp/fixes-TIMESTAMP.md`
- Update phase_state.json: corrective_pass_complete

**This is the FINAL implementation pass. No third pass allowed.**

---

### Phase 5b & 6b: Re-validation

**Agents:** `nextjs-standards-enforcer` + `nextjs-design-reviewer`

**Process:** Same as Phase 5 & 6, but after corrective pass

**Gate Thresholds:** Same (≥90)

**If gates still fail:**
- Do NOT loop again
- Report final scores
- Mark work as "Completed with caveats" or "Standards not met"
- Save all violations as new standards in vibe.db
- Allow user to decide next steps

---

### Phase 8: Verification (Lint + Build + Test)

**Agent:** `nextjs-verification-agent`

**Input:**
- All modified files
- ContextBundle

**Tasks:**
1. Resolve commands from `package.json` and project structure:
   - Lint (TS style gate): prefer `npm run lint` (ESLint), or `npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx` when no script exists.
   - Tests: `npm test`, `npm run test`, `next test`, Playwright scripts, etc.
   - Build: `npm run build` or project equivalent.
2. Run verification in this order:
   - Lint (ESLint-based TS style gate),
   - Tests (if configured),
   - Build.
3. Capture exit codes and high-level summaries for each command.
4. Classify `verification_status` and record `commands_run` in `phase_state.verification`.

**Output:**
- Lint summary (errors/warnings, key rules broken) when lint is configured
- Build status (success/failure) and brief output summary
- Test results (if run)

**Success Criteria:**
- Lint (if configured) succeeds (ESLint TS style gate passes)
- Build succeeds with no errors
- Tests pass when a test script exists
- No new high-severity warnings introduced

**Artifacts:**
- Build log: `.claude/orchestration/evidence/build-TIMESTAMP.log`
- Test results: `.claude/orchestration/evidence/test-TIMESTAMP.log`
- Update phase_state.json:
  - `verification_status` (`pass` | `fail` | `partial`)
  - `commands_run`: array of strings with the exact shell commands
    executed via the Bash tool (e.g. `"npm run lint"`, `"npm run build"`).

> NOTE: A pre-tool hook records every Bash tool command into a command
> log. When `verification_status` is set to `"pass"`, the hook checks
> that each entry in `verification.commands_run` actually appears in
> that log. If any claimed command was never executed, the write to
> `phase_state.json` is blocked and the verification gate is considered
> failed.

---

### GATE: Build Gate

**Threshold:** Build must succeed (exit code 0)

**If PASS:**
- Proceed to Completion

**If FAIL:**
- Block completion
- Report build errors
- Require manual fix (beyond pipeline scope)
- Update phase_state.json: gates_failed

---

### Phase 9: Completion

**Agent:** Orca (direct)

**Tasks:**
1. Verify all gates passed
2. Collect all artifacts
3. Save task history to vibe.db
4. Update phase_state.json to "completed"
5. Generate final summary

**Task History Record:**

## Constraint Framework

Every agent in this pipeline MUST adhere to these constraints:

### Required Context

```yaml
required_context:
  - ContextBundle from ProjectContextServer
  - design-dna.json (if exists)
  - Related standards from vibe.db
  - Past decisions for this domain
```

### Forbidden Operations

```yaml
forbidden_operations:
  - inline_styles: "Use design-dna.json tokens only"
  - component_rewrites: "Edit existing components, never rewrite"
  - arbitrary_values: "All values must come from design system"
  - scope_expansion: "Strictly implement requested changes only"
  - third_pass: "Maximum 2 implementation passes allowed"
```

### Verification Required

```yaml
verification_required:
  - lint_check: "Run before claiming done"
  - typecheck: "Run before claiming done"
  - standards_audit: "Via frontend-standards-enforcer"
  - design_qa: "Via frontend-design-reviewer-agent"
  - build: "Must succeed to complete"
```

---

## Configuration

### Default Stack Assumption

```yaml
stack:
  framework: "Next.js App Router"
  language: "TypeScript"
  styling: "auto-detect"  # Detects: semantic CSS, Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components
  design_system: "design-dna.json"
```

**Styling Auto-Detection:**
The pipeline detects the project's styling approach by checking for:
- `tailwind.config.*` → Tailwind CSS
- `*.module.css` usage → CSS Modules
- `@layer` declarations → Semantic CSS
- `styled-components` / `@emotion` → CSS-in-JS

The appropriate specialist is selected based on detection:
- Semantic CSS / @layer → `nextjs-css-specialist`
- Tailwind → `nextjs-tailwind-specialist`
- CSS Modules → `nextjs-layout-specialist`

### File Limits

```yaml
file_limits:
  simple_task:
    max_files_edited: 2
  medium_task:
    max_files_edited: 5
  complex_task:
    max_files_edited: 10
```

### Gate Thresholds

```yaml
gate_thresholds:
  standards_score: 90
  design_qa_score: 90
  build_status: "success"
  test_status: "success"  # if tests exist
```

### Implementation Pass Limits

```yaml
implementation:
  max_passes: 2
  pass_1: "Initial implementation"
  pass_2: "Corrective only (if gates fail)"
  pass_3: "FORBIDDEN - Never allowed"
```

---

## Integration with Other Systems

### ProjectContextServer

Every pipeline execution starts with:
```typescript
const contextBundle = await queryContext({
  domain: 'webdev',
  task: request,
  projectPath: cwd,
  maxFiles: 10,
  includeHistory: true
});
```

### vibe.db (Memory Store)

Pipeline records:
1. **Decisions:** When novel architectural choices are made
2. **Standards:** When new violations are discovered
3. **Task History:** At completion, with outcome and learnings
4. **Events:** At each phase transition

### phase_state.json

Pipeline maintains:
```json
{
  "domain": "nextjs",
  "request": "...",
  "current_phase": "implementation",
  "phases": {
    "context_query": { "status": "completed", "context_bundle_id": "..." },
    "planning": { "status": "completed" },
    "analysis": { "status": "completed" },
    "implementation_pass_1": { "status": "completed", "files_modified": [...] },
    "standards_enforcement": { "status": "completed", "score": 95 },
    "design_qa": { "status": "completed", "score": 92 },
    "verification": { "status": "in_progress" }
  },
  "gates_passed": ["customization_gate", "standards_gate", "design_qa_gate"],
  "gates_failed": [],
  "artifacts": [
    ".claude/orchestration/evidence/standards-20251119.md",
    ".claude/orchestration/evidence/design-qa-20251119.md"
  ]
}
```

---

## Pipeline Evolution

As the pipeline runs, it learns:

1. **New Standards:** Violations → Standards in vibe.db
2. **Common Patterns:** Task history reveals recurring work
3. **Gate Calibration:** Adjust thresholds if too strict/loose
4. **Agent Performance:** Track which agents need improvement

**Review quarterly:** Analyze task_history to improve pipeline phases, gates, and constraints.

---

## Example Execution

**Request:** "Fix spacing on the pricing card component"

**Phase 1:** Context Query
- Finds: pricing-card.tsx, design-dna.json, 3 past pricing decisions
- Standards: "Use 8px spacing scale", "Mobile spacing increases 1.5x"

**Phase 2:** Planning
- Component: src/components/pricing-card.tsx
- Tokens: spacing.sm, spacing.md (from design-dna.json)
- Complexity: Simple (1 component)

**GATE:** Customization
- No custom colors/fonts/spacing requested → PASS

**Phase 3:** Analysis
- Current spacing: Uses hardcoded values (violation!)
- Dependencies: Imported by pricing-page.tsx
- Recommendation: Replace with spacing tokens

**Phase 4:** Implementation Pass 1
- Edit: Replace `padding: 12px` with `padding: var(--space-3)`
- Edit: Replace `gap: 16px` with `gap: var(--space-4)`
- Verify: Lint passes, typecheck passes

**Phase 5:** Standards Enforcement
- Check: No inline styles 
- Check: All values from tokens 
- Check: No rewrites 
- Score: 100 (PASS)

**Phase 6:** Design QA
