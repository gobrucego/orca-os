# iOS Domain Pipeline

**Status:** OS 2.3 Core Pipeline (Native iOS)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25

## Overview

The iOS pipeline handles **native iOS app development** using Swift 6.x and modern Apple frameworks (SwiftUI, UIKit, Swift Concurrency). It combines:

- OS 2.3 primitives (ProjectContextServer, phase_state.json, vibe.db, Workshop, constraint framework)
- Memory-first context (Workshop + vibe.db before ProjectContext)
- Complexity-based routing (simple → light orchestrator, medium/complex → full pipeline)
- Spec gating (complex tasks require requirements spec)
- Response Awareness tagging (RA tags surface assumptions and decisions)
- Swift/iOS specialist agents including `ios-light-orchestrator` for quick tasks
- Full pipeline agents (`ios-grand-architect`, `ios-architect`, `ios-builder`, `ios-standards-enforcer`, `ios-ui-reviewer`, `ios-verification`)
- Design DNA/tokens for UI work; persistence strategy (SwiftData vs Core Data/GRDB) when relevant.

Goal: implement and evolve native iOS features with **architecture-aware plans**, **safety and concurrency guarantees**, **structured gates** for quality, and **learning loops** that harden the system over time.

---

## Complexity Tiers (OS 2.3)

The iOS pipeline routes tasks based on complexity:

| Tier | Routing | Spec Required | Gates | Example |
|------|---------|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Simple** | `ios-light-orchestrator` | No | No | Fix button padding, add haptic |
| **Medium** | Full pipeline | Recommended | Yes | New component, single screen |
| **Complex** | Full pipeline | **Required** | Yes | Multi-screen flow, architecture |

Use `-tweak` flag to force light path: `/orca-ios -tweak "fix padding"`

---

## Standards Inputs (OS 2.3 Learning Loop)

Standards flow into and out of the iOS pipeline:

### Input Sources

1. **ContextBundle.relatedStandards** (from ProjectContext/vibe.db)
   - iOS-specific standards saved from past tasks
   - Architecture decisions and patterns
   - Gotchas and anti-patterns

2. **Workshop.gotchas** (from session memory)
   - Recent gotchas tagged with "ios"
   - Decisions with reasoning

3. **/audit-derived standards** (from past audits)
   - Standards created via `mcp__project-context__save_standard`
   - Pattern: "What happened → Cost → Rule"

### Gate Enforcement

`ios-standards-enforcer` MUST:
- Read `relatedStandards` from ContextBundle
- Treat them as **enforceable rules**, not suggestions
- Tag violations to the specific standard they break
- This enables `/audit` to track "standard X keeps being violated"

### Output (Learning Loop Closure)

After task completion:
1. Recurring violations → `mcp__project-context__save_standard` (via /audit)
2. New standards flow into future `relatedStandards`
3. Future tasks see and enforce the new standard

```
violation → /audit → save_standard → vibe.db → future relatedStandards → gate enforcement
```

---

## Scope & Domain

Use this pipeline when:
- The task clearly concerns a native iOS (or Apple platform) app:
  - Keywords: "iOS app", "SwiftUI", "UIKit", "Xcode", "iPhone", "iPad".
  - Files: `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Sources/**/*.swift`, Swift packages.

If the request is for:
- Expo/React Native mobile → use the **Expo** pipeline.
- Browser-based React/Next.js work → use the **webdev** pipeline.

    ↓
[Phase 8: Completion & Learning (vibe.db)]
```

---

## Phase Definitions

### Phase 1: Context Query (MANDATORY)

**Agent:** ProjectContextServer (MCP tool)  
**Invoker:** `/orca`

**Input:**
```json
{
  "domain": "ios",
  "task": "<user request>",
  "projectPath": "<cwd>",
  "maxFiles": 15,
  "includeHistory": true
}
```

**Output:** ContextBundle containing:
- `relevantFiles` – Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit files for the feature/bug.
- `projectState` – targets, schemes, modules, architecture hints (SwiftUI vs UIKit, MVVM/TCA/MVC).
- `pastDecisions` – prior iOS decisions, refactors, gotchas.
- `relatedStandards` – iOS standards from `vibe.db` (architecture, concurrency, safety, design DNA pointers).
- `similarTasks` – previous iOS tasks and outcomes.

**Artifacts:**
- ContextBundle stored in `phase_state.json`.
- Context event logged in `vibe.db.events`.

---

### Phase 2: Requirements & Impact Analysis

**Agent:** `ios-architect`

**Tasks:**
1. Restate the request clearly (what feature/bug/refactor is needed).
2. Identify:
   - Affected screens/views (SwiftUI views, view controllers, navigation flows).
   - Affected state/business logic (stores, reducers, view models, services).
   - External dependencies (APIs, persistence, feature flags).
   - Design DNA / token sources if UI changes are in scope.
3. Classify change type:
   - `bugfix`, `small_feature`, `multi_screen_feature`, `structural`.
4. Estimate impact and risk:
   - Modules and targets touched.
   - Sensitive areas (auth, payments, offline, critical flows).

**Artifacts:**
- Impact summary in `phase_state.json`.
- Optional decision note saved via ProjectContextServer.

---

### Phase 3: Architecture & Plan

**Agents:**
- `ios-architect` (primary planner)
- iOS specialists (e.g. `ios-swiftui-specialist` indirectly)

**Tasks:**
1. Choose architecture path:
   - **Modern SwiftUI path** (Swift 6, SwiftUI 18/26, `@Observable` + `@Environment(Object.self)`):
     - For SwiftUI-first features/projects without entrenched MVVM/TCA.
   - **Existing architecture path** (MVVM, TCA, UIKit/MVC):
     - Follow existing patterns; do not forcibly rewrite architecture.
   - Choose data layer strategy (SwiftData for iOS 17+/Swift 6 unless project is locked to Core Data/GRDB; do not migrate implicitly).
2. Define:
   - Which types/modules will be extended or created.
   - How state and data flow should be wired (reducers/view models/stores).
   - How UI and navigation will change.
   - Testing strategy (what tests should exist, Swift Testing vs XCTest per project).
3. Produce a concise, stepwise plan:
   - UI changes.
   - Logic changes.
   - Tests.
   - Verification.

**Artifacts:**
- Plan stored in `phase_state.json`.
- Optional plan spec: `.claude/orchestration/specs/ios-feature-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

---

### Phase 4: Implementation – Pass 1

**Agents:** `ios-builder` (primary), with specialists as needed:
- SwiftUI work: `ios-swiftui-specialist`.
- UIKit-heavy work: `ios-uikit-specialist`.
- Tokens: `design-dna-guardian` to enforce design DNA.
- Data: `ios-persistence-specialist` when persistence is touched.
- Networking: `ios-networking-specialist` for API work.
- Testing: `ios-testing-specialist` / `ios-ui-testing-specialist`.

**Constraints (HARD):**
- Use Swift 6.x semantics and modern concurrency by default.
- Respect architecture plan from Phase 3:
  - If SwiftUI-native: prefer `@Observable` + `@Environment` over new view models.
  - If MVVM/TCA/UIKit: follow the dominant pattern.
- Use the project’s design DNA/tokens for UI-forward work; do not hardcode ad-hoc styling.
- Keep edits cohesive and scoped to the modules/features identified.
- Add/update tests where new logic is introduced.

**Tasks:**
1. Apply the architecture plan:
   - Implement or update views/controllers and logic.
2. Add tests:
   - Unit tests for business logic.
   - Reducer/view model tests if applicable.
3. Run local checks (via Xcode tools when available):
   - Build the affected module/target.
   - Run relevant tests.

**Artifacts:**
- Modified files recorded in `phase_state.json`.
- Implementation summary in an implementation log (optional).

---

### Phase 5: Standards & Safety Gate

**Agent:** `ios-standards-enforcer`

**Inputs:**
- Modified Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit files.
- ContextBundle (architecture, standards, past decisions).

**Checks:**
- Architecture:
  - No unexpected patterns contrary to the chosen path.
- Concurrency:
  - Proper use of `async/await`, actors, `@MainActor`.
  - Avoid unnecessary GCD where Swift Concurrency is available.
- Safety:
  - Force unwraps and unsafe casts only where justified.
  - Reasonable error handling paths (no silent failures).
- Testing:
  - New logic has tests where appropriate.

**Output:**
- Standards Score (0–100).
- Gate label: PASS / CAUTION / FAIL.

---

### Phase 6: UI / Interaction QA Gate

**Agent:** `ios-ui-reviewer`

**Inputs:**
- Feature/flow under review.
- Target/scheme and navigation steps (how to reach the feature).
- Any design/UX notes.

**Checks:**
- Layout & visuals on relevant devices.
- Navigation and flow correctness.
- Interaction behavior (taps, gestures, loading/error states).
- Basic accessibility concerns.

**Output:**
- Design/Interaction Score (0–100).
- Gate label: PASS / CAUTION / FAIL.

---

### Gates and Corrective Pass

Gate thresholds (suggested):
- **Standards Gate:** PASS if Standards Score ≥ 90 and no critical issues.
- **UI/Interaction Gate:** PASS if Score ≥ 90 and no blockers.

If any critical gate FAILS:
- Allow exactly **one** corrective **Implementation Pass 2**:
  - Scope only to gate-surfaced issues.
  - Re-run Phase 5 and Phase 6 afterwards.
- If still failing:
  - Mark outcome as “partial / standards not met” and require human decision.

---

### Phase 4b: Implementation – Pass 2 (Corrective)

Same implementation agents as Phase 4, but:
- Scope strictly to issues from Standards and UI gates.
- No new features or expansions.

---

### Phase 7: Build & Test Verification

**Agent:** `ios-verification`

**Tasks:**
1. Build the iOS app for the appropriate scheme/target using Xcode tools:
   - `xcodebuild` or XcodeBuildMCP (if available).
2. Run tests:
   - Relevant unit/integration/UI tests.
3. Capture:
   - Build status.
   - Test results and failures.

**Gate:**
- PASS only if the build succeeds and relevant tests pass.

---

### Phase 8: Completion & Learning

**Agents:** `/orca` + ProjectContextServer integrations

**Tasks:**
1. Confirm gate outcomes and artifacts:
   - Standards, UI, Build/Test gates passed or explicitly waived.
   - Evidence (logs, screenshots) stored where appropriate.
2. Save task history:
   - Domain: `ios`.
   - Task description.
   - Outcome (`success` | `partial` | `failure`).
   - Files/modules modified.
   - Gate scores and decisions.
3. Update memory:
   - Insert new events/standards into `vibe.db`.
   - Save architecture decisions via ProjectContextServer.

**Artifacts:**
- Task history record in `vibe.db`.
- Updated iOS standards where applicable.

---

## Failure Scenarios & Recovery

### Scenario 1: Build/Test Gate Fails After Corrective Pass

**What happened:** Standards/UI gates passed, but build or tests fail.

**Cause:** Code compiles locally but breaks in full build context, or tests fail due to integration issues.

**Recovery:**
1. Mark task as "partial completion" in `vibe.db`.
2. Log failure with gate scores + build/test errors.
3. Present user with:
   - Build/test errors with file/line references.
   - Options: manual fix | rollback changes | accept partial state.
4. If rollback chosen: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- <files_modified>`.

---

### Scenario 2: Both Gates Fail After Pass 2

**What happened:** Corrective pass (Pass 2) didn't meet 90+ threshold on Standards or UI gates.

**Cause:** Issues too complex for single corrective iteration; architectural problems requiring redesign.

**Recovery:**
1. BLOCK pipeline completion.
2. Report final scores (e.g., Standards: 82, UI: 75).
3. Save violations as new standards via ProjectContextServer to prevent future occurrences.
4. Require human decision:
   - Manual fix (continue outside pipeline).
   - Accept partial (merge with known issues).
   - Rollback entirely (restore original state).

---

### Scenario 3: Design DNA Missing (Hard Block)

**What happened:** `design-dna-guardian` blocks UI implementation due to missing design tokens.

**Cause:** No `design-dna.json` or `DesignTokens.swift` found in project or `.claude/design-dna/`.

**Detection:** ios-grand-architect identifies early in Phase 2 (Requirements & Impact).

**Recovery:**
1. BLOCK pipeline immediately.
2. Ask user via AskUserQuestion:
   - "Create minimal design DNA now?" → Quick-start wizard.
   - "Use universal-taste.json?" → Copy from `~/.claude/design-dna/universal-taste.json`.
   - "Skip UI work, logic only?" → Proceed with backend/logic changes only.
3. If design DNA created, save decision and restart from Phase 2.
4. If skipped, adjust plan scope to exclude UI changes.

---

### Scenario 4: ProjectContextServer Timeout

**What happened:** MCP tool `mcp__project-context__query_context` doesn't respond within 10s.

**Cause:** Large repository, slow vector database, network latency, or MCP server crash.

**Recovery:**
1. Retry once with extended timeout (30s).
2. If still fails, enter DEGRADED mode:
   - Use `Grep`/`Glob` to manually locate relevant Swift files.
   - Skip `pastDecisions`, `relatedStandards`, and `similarTasks`.
   - Warn: "Context quality reduced – operating with limited history".
3. Log degraded context event to `vibe.db`.
4. Proceed with available context (architect makes more conservative decisions).

---

### Scenario 5: Rollback After Broken Implementation

**What happened:** New implementation breaks existing features not covered by tests.

**Cause:** Side effects, unexpected dependencies, or regression in untested paths.

**Detection:** User reports: "Feature X is now broken after your changes".

**Recovery:**
1. Identify files modified via `phase_state.json` → `implementation.filesModified`.
2. Git rollback: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- <files_modified>`.
3. Log failure to `vibe.db`:
   - Outcome: `failure`.
   - Learnings: "Implementation caused regression in Feature X".
4. Save as new standard: "When modifying Y, verify Feature X still works".
5. Optionally restart pipeline with stricter constraints:
   - Add Feature X to verification checklist.
   - Require manual QA gate before completion.
