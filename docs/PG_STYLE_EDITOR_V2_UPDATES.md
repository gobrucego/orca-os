# PG Style Editor V2 - Research Focus Updates

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Purpose**: Updated skill for long-form research writing without first-person voice

---

## What Changed

### 1. Added 10 More Long-Form Essays

**New Essays Analyzed**:
1. The Origins of Wokeness
2. Superlinear Returns
3. How to Get New Ideas
4. The Four Quadrants of Conformism
5. Modeling a Wealth Tax
6. Economic Inequality
7. The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius
8. A Unified Theory of VC Suckage
9. How to Make Wealth
10. How to Raise Money

**Total**: 35 essays analyzed (25 original + 10 long-form)

### 2. Removed First-Person Requirement

**Old Principle #3 (Conversational)**:
```
Tone: Conversational Authority
- Use "I" and "you" freely
- Admit uncertainty: "I may be wrong"
- Self-deprecating: "I only figured this out recently"
- Think-aloud quality: "It struck me that..."
```

**New Principle #3 (Research)**:
```
Tone: Accessible Formality
- Objective statements instead of first-person
- Clear assertions without false hedging
- Acknowledge complexity when genuine
  - "The evidence remains inconclusive"
  - "This model represents the most optimistic case"
- Guide thinking with questions
  - "What's going on here?"
  - "Why there? And why then?"
```

### 3. Updated for Research Writing

#### Paragraph Length
- **Old**: 2-5 sentences typical
- **New**: 3-6 sentences typical, up to 10 for complex arguments

#### Evidence Types
Added research-specific evidence categories:
1. Historical examples (named people, companies, events)
2. Numerical data (specific metrics, percentages, timelines)
3. Systematic patterns (multiple cases showing trend)
4. Thought experiments (grounded hypotheticals)

#### Structure Elements
Added long-form elements:
- Section headers
- Numbered lists for systematic analysis
- Tables/data for scanability
- Transitional paragraphs
- Footnotes for scholarly rigor

### 4. Updated Example

**Old Example (Conversational)**:
```
We need better software to work faster. This means building tools that let our
team ship features in days, not months. When Stripe did this, they went from
"someday" to profitable in two years.
```

**New Example (Research)**:
```
Organizations face a recurring problem: manual processes consume resources
better spent on core work. Software automation addresses this directly. When
Stripe automated deployment, release time dropped from hours to minutes.
Engineers shipped features 10x faster. The pattern holds across industries.
```

**Key differences**:
- No "we/our" → "Organizations"
- No first-person → objective statements
- Concrete metrics → "10x faster", "hours to minutes"
- Pattern generalization → "holds across industries"
