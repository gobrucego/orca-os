# OS 2.1 Documentation Index

**Version:** OS 2.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-24

This folder contains the documentation for the OS 2.1 orchestration system used by Claude Code. For the main overview, see the [project README](/README.md).

---

## What's New in OS 2.1

**Major Changes:**
- ✅ **Unified Planning** - `/plan` command replaces 8+ fragmented requirements commands
- ✅ **Meta-Audit System** - `/audit` command for behavior review with Response Awareness
- ✅ **Role Boundary Enforcement** - Orchestrators NEVER write code (explicit enforcement)
- ✅ **State Preservation** - `phase_state.json` survives interruptions
- ✅ **Team Confirmation** - Mandatory AskUserQuestion before pipeline execution
- ✅ **Grand Architect Pattern** - Opus for coordination, Sonnet for implementation (57 agents)

**Workflow Evolution:**
```
OS 2.0: requirements-start → requirements-status → response-awareness-plan → response-awareness-implement
OS 2.1: /plan → /orca-{domain} → /audit
```

### Phase Configurations
Location: `reference/phase-configs/`

## OS 2.1 Key Concepts

### 1. Role Boundary Enforcement (NEW)
**Problem in OS 2.0:** Orchestrators would abandon their role and start coding directly when users interrupted with questions.

**Solution in OS 2.1:** Explicit enforcement in all orca commands:
```markdown
🚨 CRITICAL ROLE BOUNDARY 🚨
YOU ARE AN ORCHESTRATOR. YOU NEVER WRITE CODE.
```

**Result:** Orchestration survives interruptions (questions, clarifications, pauses).

### 2. State Preservation (NEW)
**Mechanism:** `phase_state.json` tracks:
- Current phase
- Completed phases
- Agent assignments
- Gate results
- Interruption count

**Usage:** Orchestrators read this file after ANY user input to resume correctly.

### 3. Team Confirmation (NEW)
**Before execution:** Orchestrators present proposed agent team via AskUserQuestion tool and wait for user approval.

**Benefits:**
- No surprise teams
- Cost transparency (Opus vs Sonnet)
- User controls scope

### 4. Unified Planning (NEW)
**Old Way (OS 2.0):**
- /requirements-start
- /requirements-status
- /requirements-end
- /response-awareness-plan
- /response-awareness-implement

**New Way (OS 2.1):**
- `/plan "feature description"` → Creates blueprint at `requirements/<id>/06-requirements-spec.md`
- `/orca-{domain} "implement requirement <id>"` → Executes with full pipeline
- `/audit "last N tasks"` → Meta-review for continuous improvement

### 5. Grand Architect Pattern (NEW)
**Opus Agents (3):** High-level coordination
- ios-grand-architect
- nextjs-grand-architect
- expo-grand-orchestrator

**Sonnet Agents (54):** All implementation work
- Builders, specialists, gates, verification

**Benefit:** Optimal cost (expensive models for strategy, efficient models for work)

## Research / Historical Docs

These are **older or exploratory** documents kept for context. They may still contain useful ideas but are not the canonical spec:

- `architecture/vibe-code-os-v2-brainstorm.md` – Early brainstorm (pre-2.1)
- `architecture/structure-audit.md` – Earlier structural analysis
- `architecture/configuration-record.md` – Background context
- `architecture/data-analyst-team-guide.md` – Superseded by data-pipeline.md
- `prompts-research/` – Prompt and quality research notes
- `sessions/` – OS 2.0 session logs and reflections

**When in doubt:**
- Use the **Core OS 2.1 Docs** for behavior and implementation
- Treat research/historical docs as inspiration, not contracts
- Check the [main README](/README.md) for the authoritative OS 2.1 overview

---

## Getting Started with OS 2.1

1. **Understand the workflow:**
   ```
   /plan "feature" → requirements/<id>/06-requirements-spec.md
   /orca-nextjs "implement requirement <id>" → full pipeline with gates
   /audit "last 5 tasks" → continuous improvement
   ```

2. **Learn the commands:** See [os2-commands.md](../quick-reference/os2-commands.md)

3. **Know the agents:** See [os2-agents.md](../quick-reference/os2-agents.md)

4. **Understand the architecture:** See [os2-architecture.md](../quick-reference/os2-architecture.md)

5. **Read pipeline specs:** See `pipelines/` for domain-specific details
