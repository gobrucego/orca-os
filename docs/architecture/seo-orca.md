# SEO-ORCA

AI-assisted research and drafting support for the 3–4 flagship pieces we publish each month.  
SEO-ORCA blends rapid machine research with deliberate human storytelling—letting the system sweep the landscape while we stay focused on insight, positioning, and polish.

## Why this approach is different

1. **Research-first DNA** – Every article starts with live competitors, not “AI memory.” The pipeline scrapes the current SERP, reads what’s working now, and hands us summaries, takeaways, and tone cues.
2. **Dual-brain strategy** – GPT‑5 distills the heavy reading, while GPT‑5 Pro + Claude 4.5 Sonnet collaborate on angles, follow-up questions, and guardrails. We decide what belongs in the narrative.
3. **Right-sized for our cadence** – It’s built for a handful of deep pieces each month, not a 50-post content mill. The output is a reusable research pack we can drop into Airtable, Notion, or our own outlines.
4. **Human gate remains firm** – Automation ends at the brief. Drafting, fact-checking, and final voice stay human so we keep the credibility and personality that make our pieces land.
5. **Efficient and rapid experimentation** – Move fast on new keywords, test POVs, and reduce manual research load while keeping the edit cycle focused on strategy, fact-checking, and final voice.

## What Exists Today

| Step | Output | Where it lives |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1. SERP gather | Top 3 organic results for a keyword | In-memory during run |
| 2. Content extraction | Clean article text (when accessible) | `outputs/seo/<slug>-report.json` |
| 3. GPT / heuristic analysis | Per-article summaries, key takeaways, tone notes | Same JSON report |
| 4. Combined insights | Cross-article themes, starter outline, keyword list | Same JSON report |
| 5. Research brief (optional GPT) | Market context, angles, follow-up questions | Same JSON report |

All of this is generated by a single script:

```bash
python3 scripts/seo_auto_pipeline.py "YOUR KEYWORD"
```

Example: `python3 scripts/seo_auto_pipeline.py "GLOW Peptide"`  
Output: `outputs/seo/glow-peptide-report.json`

Each run takes ~3 seconds and lays down a research pack you can drop into Airtable or your personal notes before outlining the piece.

---

## Using GPT-5 / GPT-Pro

The script automatically upgrades its summaries and research brief when an OpenAI key is available.

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell.
2. (Optional) Override models:
   ```bash
   export SEO_GPT_SUMMARIZER_MODEL="gpt-5"
   export SEO_GPT_RESEARCH_MODEL="gpt-5"     # default already uses GPT-5 Pro
   ```
3. (Optional) Bring in Claude 3.5 Sonnet for strategy and guardrails:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"
   export SEO_SONNET_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
   ```
4. Run the script as normal.

If the key is missing or the call fails, the script falls back to the built-in heuristic summariser so you still get a usable report.

## Working With the Report

Each JSON file contains:

```json
{
  "keyword": "GLOW Peptide",
  "articles_analyzed": 3,
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "summary": "...",
      "key_takeaways": ["..."],
      "tone_notes": "Clinical and research-backed",
      "insights": ["Glow peptide protocol", "Tissue repair", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "combined_summary": "...",
  "combined_insights": ["..."],
  "outline": [
    "Introduction: Overview of GLOW Peptide",
    "Glow peptide protocol",
    "Tissue repair",
    "Conclusion and next steps"
  ],
  "keyword_suggestions": [
    {"keyword": "peptide", "score": 57},
    {"keyword": "collagen", "score": 39}
  ],
  "research_brief": {
    "market_context": "...",
    "angles_to_cover": ["..."],
    "questions_to_answer": ["..."],
    "data_points_to_hunt": ["..."],
    "storytelling_hooks": ["..."],
    "risk_flags": ["..."],
    "expert_sources": ["..."],
    "refresh_triggers": ["..."]
  }
}
```

Suggested workflow for our monthly cadence:

1. **Kickoff** – Run the script for the month’s focus keyword(s). Skim the summaries and key takeaways.
2. **Outline review** – Use the suggested outline and combined insights as a starting point. Adjust for voice, POV, and current offers.
3. **Manual validation** – Fact-check anything you carry forward. The script does not browse or verify live data.
4. **Draft** – Either brief a writer or continue into the existing agent stack (to be wired in Reps 2–5).
5. **Human review** – Every draft still gets a full editorial pass before publication.

---

## Example | “GLOW Peptide”

Running `python3 scripts/seo_auto_pipeline.py "GLOW Peptide"` produced:

- **Articles analysed:** 3 (AllAboutPeptides, MuscleAndBrawn, UKSARMS) with full summaries, tone notes (“clinical”, “promotional”), and 5 key takeaways each.
- **Combined outline:** Sections suggested “Glow peptide protocol”, “Tissue repair benefits”, “Safety and side effects”, “At-home vs clinic delivery”.
- **Keyword list:** `peptide`, `collagen`, `recovery`, `inflammation`, `bpc-157`, `ghk-cu`.
- **GPT‑5 brief:** Market framing (“post-injury recovery programs are repositioning peptides as mainstream wellness”), five differentiation angles, four follow-up questions, and “data points to hunt” (post-surgery recovery stats, collagen synthesis rates, price comparisons).
- **Sonnet addendum:** Narrative hooks (e.g., “rehab diary comparing week-by-week healing”), compliance cautions (medical disclaimers, FDA posture), expert source suggestions (sports med physicians, compounding pharmacists), plus refresh triggers (upcoming regulatory hearings).

It’s enough to shape a POV, gather supporting data, and brief a writer without rereading every Google result from scratch.

## Why This Matters For Us

- **Faster research** – Cut the initial reconnaissance pass from ~2 hours to minutes while still reading the original sources.
- **Consistent briefs** – Each piece starts with the same baseline: competitor landscape, summary, angles, and questions to answer.
- **Flexible output** – A JSON file slots into Airtable, Notion, or the upcoming orchestration layer.
- **Scales to 3–4 pieces/month** – Enough structure to stay consistent, without the overhead of a high-volume publishing machine.

---

## Next Enhancements (Upcoming Reps)

1. **Phase II – Summaries & Outline to Airtable**  
   Parse the JSON into Airtable/context-manager so the research pack is one click away inside the broader agent workflow.

2. **Phase III – Metric enrichment + telemetry**  
   Pair the research pack with search-volume/difficulty data and log run telemetry for each article.

3. **Phase IV – Structured brief + governance flags**  
   Auto-generate the final brief (title/meta/schema suggestions, E‑E‑A‑T requirements) and surface review flags.

4. **Phase V – Multi-agent drafting**  
   Bring Sonnet 4.5 / GPT-5 writers online for section-level drafting, still gated by human review.

Throughout every stage we keep two non-negotiables: **100% human review before anything publishes** and **manual validation of facts and claims**, especially for health or product-related pages.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **“Could not extract readable text”** – The site blocks scraping. Open the article manually and copy key sections into your notes.
- **Empty `keyword_suggestions`** – Happens when only one short article was retrievable. Add supporting research manually.
- **GPT errors or empty `gpt_research_brief`** – Check your API key or model names; the rest of the report is still usable.
