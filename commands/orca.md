# ⛔ MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES - READ BEFORE ANYTHING ⛔

**REQUEST:** $ARGUMENTS

## HARD STOP: YOU MUST DELEGATE

**YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO:**
- ❌ Use the Edit tool
- ❌ Use the Write tool
- ❌ Use the MultiEdit tool
- ❌ Modify any source code files
- ❌ "Just do it yourself" for "simple" tasks
- ❌ Read source code files to "understand" the task (that's the agent's job)

**IF YOU CATCH YOURSELF ABOUT TO:**
- Read a `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.js`, `.swift`, `.css`, `.py` file to "see what needs to change"
- Think "this is simple, I'll just do it myself"
- Use Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools

**STOP. You are violating /orca protocol. You MUST delegate to a grand-architect agent via the Task tool.**

## YOUR ONLY JOB IS:
1. Detect pipeline type (nextjs/ios/expo/data/seo/design)
2. Query ProjectContext ONCE
3. Confirm with user via AskUserQuestion
4. Call Task tool with appropriate grand-architect
5. That's it. You're done. The grand-architect does the work.

## FIRST ACTION MUST BE:
Your very first tool call MUST be one of:
- `Bash` (to run `pwd`)
- `Bash` (to check for existing plan)
- `mcp__project-context__query_context`
- `AskUserQuestion`

Your first tool call MUST NOT be:
- `Read` on any source file
- `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit`
- `Grep` on source code (only on config/plan files)

# /orca – OS 2.3 Pure Orchestrator

**Philosophy:** Orca is a pure coordinator. It NEVER writes code. It detects the pipeline type, queries context ONCE, integrates with /plan if needed, and delegates to domain orchestrators.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Single Entry Point** - One command for all pipelines
2. **Memory-First Context** - Check Workshop/vibe.db before expensive ProjectContext queries
3. **Context Query Once** - ProjectContextServer called once, passed to domain orchestrators
4. **Plan Integration** - Checks for /plan output, offers to plan if needed
5. **Pipeline Detection** - Auto-detects: nextjs, ios, expo, data, seo, design, shopify
6. **Domain Routing** - Routes to `/orca-{domain}` commands for specialized handling
7. **Never Codes** - Orchestrates agents, doesn't implement

**OS 2.3 Updates:**
- Memory-first context (Workshop + vibe.db before ProjectContext)
- Routes to domain-specific `/orca-{domain}` commands which handle complexity routing
- Domain orchestrators handle `-tweak` flags and spec gating internally

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Detect Working Directory

```bash
pwd
```

---

### Step 1.5: Memory-First Context (OS 2.3)

**Before expensive ProjectContext queries, check local memory:**

```bash
# Search Workshop for relevant decisions/gotchas
workshop --workspace .claude/memory why "$TASK_KEYWORDS"

# Search vibe.db for relevant code/symbols (if available)
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/memory-search-unified.py "$TASK_KEYWORDS" --mode all --top-k 5
```

**If memory hits are relevant:**
- Note them for context
- May skip or reduce ProjectContext query scope
- Pass memory summary to domain orchestrators

---

### Step 2: Check for Existing Plan/Spec

Check if `/plan` has been run and load the spec:

```bash
# Check for active requirement
if [ -f requirements/.current-requirement ]; then
  REQ_FOLDER=$(cat requirements/.current-requirement)
  echo "Active requirement: $REQ_FOLDER"

  # Check for spec file
  if [ -f "requirements/$REQ_FOLDER/06-requirements-spec.md" ]; then
    echo "Spec found: requirements/$REQ_FOLDER/06-requirements-spec.md"
  fi
fi
```

**If spec exists (`06-requirements-spec.md`):**

1. **READ THE SPEC** - This is your source of truth:
   ```bash
   cat requirements/$REQ_FOLDER/06-requirements-spec.md
   ```

2. **Extract RA tags** from the spec:
   - `#PATH_DECISION` - Decisions already made. **DO NOT re-decide these.**
   - `#COMPLETION_DRIVE` - Assumptions needing verification during implementation
   - `#POISON_PATH` - Anti-patterns to actively avoid
   - `#CONTEXT_DEGRADED` - Areas where agents should gather extra context

3. **Store spec content** - Pass the full spec to grand architects

4. **Respect the spec** - The spec is the plan. Don't reinvent it.

**If no plan exists:**

Ask user via `AskUserQuestion`:
```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "No requirements spec found. How should we proceed?",
    header: "Planning",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {
        label: "Start planning now",
        description: "Begin discovery questions inline (recommended for complex work)"
      },
      {
        label: "I have a plan elsewhere",
        description: "Point me to an existing spec or requirements doc"
      },
      {
        label: "Skip planning",
        description: "For simple tasks - architect will plan on the fly"
      }
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Process response:**

- **"Start planning now"** → Execute `/plan` inline:
  1. Create requirements folder: `requirements/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[slug]/`
  2. Begin 5 discovery questions via AskUserQuestion
  3. After discovery, continue with 5 detail questions
  4. Generate spec file (`06-requirements-spec.md`)
  5. Then continue to Step 3 with the newly created spec

- **"I have a plan elsewhere"** → Ask for the path:
  ```typescript
  AskUserQuestion({
    questions: [{
      question: "Where is your plan/spec located?",
      header: "Plan Path",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        { label: "requirements/ folder", description: "Check for existing requirement specs" },
        { label: "Provide path", description: "I'll tell you the file path" }
      ]
    }]
  })
  ```
  Load the spec from the provided path, then continue to Step 3.

- **"Skip planning"** → Continue to Step 3 with `specContent = null`

---

### Step 3: Detect Pipeline

Analyze the request and project structure to determine pipeline:

**nextjs (webdev):**
- Keywords: React, Next.js, frontend, web app, UI, component, design system, landing page
- Files: `package.json` with `next`, `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `tailwind.config.js`, `app/` or `pages/` dirs
- Grand Architect: `nextjs-grand-architect`
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/nextjs-pipeline.md`

**ios:**
- Keywords: iOS, SwiftUI, UIKit, Xcode, simulator, iPhone, iPad, Apple
- Files: `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `*.swift`, `Info.plist`, `.swiftpm/`
- Grand Architect: `ios-grand-architect`
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/ios-pipeline.md`

**expo:**
- Keywords: Expo, React Native, mobile app, Android, iOS app (but with Expo/RN)
- Files: `app.json`, `app.config.*`, `package.json` with `expo` and `react-native`
- Grand Architect: `expo-grand-orchestrator`
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/expo-pipeline.md`

**data:**
- Keywords: analysis, BFCM, sales, metrics, causality, performance, data analysis
- Files: `*.csv`, `*.json` (data files), Python notebooks, data/ folder
- Grand Architect: Use data specialists directly (no grand-architect yet)
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/data-pipeline.md`

**seo:**
- Keywords: content, blog, article, SEO, keywords, metadata, SERP
- Files: `*.md` (content), SEO configs, content/ or blog/ folders
- Grand Architect: Use SEO specialists directly (no grand-architect yet)
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/seo-pipeline.md`

**design:**
- Keywords: design system, design tokens, Figma, landing page design, visual design, mockup, layout exploration
- Files: `design-system-v*.md`, `bento-system-v*.md`, `CSS-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.claude/design-dna/*.json`
- Grand Architect: Use design specialists directly (no grand-architect yet)
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/design-pipeline.md`

**shopify:**
- Keywords: Shopify, Liquid, theme, section, snippet, cart, product, collection, checkout
- Files: `layout/theme.liquid`, `sections/*.liquid`, `snippets/*.liquid`, `templates/*.json`, `.shopify/`
- Grand Architect: `shopify-grand-architect`
- Pipeline: `docs/pipelines/shopify-pipeline.md`

**Multi-Pipeline Work:**
If request spans multiple pipelines (e.g., "Build iOS app with backend API"):
1. Detect primary pipeline (where most work happens)
2. Note dependencies on other pipelines
3. Activate primary pipeline first
4. Coordinate cross-pipeline handoffs via phase_state.json

---

### Step 4: Query ProjectContext (ONCE)

**CRITICAL: This is the ONLY context query. Grand-architects receive this bundle.**

```typescript
// IMPORTANT: Sanitize task to avoid FTS5 syntax errors
// FTS5 special chars: / + - ( ) " *
const sanitizedTask = $ARGUMENTS
  .replace(/\//g, ' ')      // iOS/web → iOS web
  .replace(/\+/g, ',')      // A + B + C → A, B, C
  .replace(/[\-\(\)\"\*]/g, ' ')  // Remove other operators
  .trim();

// Use MCP tool: project-context/query_context
mcp__project-context__query_context({
  domain: "nextjs" | "ios" | "expo" | "data" | "seo" | "design" | "shopify",
  task: sanitizedTask,  // Use sanitized version
  projectPath: "<current working directory>",
  maxFiles: 15,
  includeHistory: true
})
```

**ContextBundle Contains:**
- `relevantFiles`: Files semantically related to the task
- `projectState`: Current component structure, dependencies
- `pastDecisions`: Previous architectural choices
- `relatedStandards`: Learned rules to enforce
- `similarTasks`: Historical task outcomes
- `designSystem`: (for webdev) Design tokens and constraints

**Store ContextBundle** - You'll pass this to the grand-architect.

---

### Step 4.5: Query Agent Outcomes (Self-Learning)

**Query Workshop for past outcomes with agents in this pipeline.**

This enables self-learning: agents learn from past successes/failures on this project.

```bash
# Query outcomes for relevant agents based on pipeline
# For nextjs pipeline:
workshop --workspace .claude/memory search "agent-outcome" -t nextjs-grand-architect -t nextjs-builder -t nextjs-architect | head -20

# For ios pipeline:
workshop --workspace .claude/memory search "agent-outcome" -t ios-grand-architect -t ios-builder -t ios-swiftui-specialist | head -20

# For expo pipeline:
workshop --workspace .claude/memory search "agent-outcome" -t expo-grand-orchestrator -t expo-builder-agent -t expo-architect-agent | head -20

# For shopify pipeline:
workshop --workspace .claude/memory search "agent-outcome" -t shopify-grand-architect -t shopify-liquid-specialist -t shopify-section-builder | head -20
```

**Store AgentOutcomes** - Include relevant outcomes in the context passed to grand-architects.

**AgentOutcomes Format** (what gets recorded after each task):
```
[agent-name]: [brief task description]
Outcome: [success/failure/partial]
What worked: [specific patterns or approaches]
What failed: [if applicable]
Time: [if relevant]
```

**Example outcomes that might be returned:**
```
ios-swiftui-specialist: profile screen implementation
Outcome: success
What worked: Used @Observable pattern, avoided Combine complexity
Time: 30min

ios-builder: navigation refactor
Outcome: partial
What worked: TabView structure
What failed: Deep linking - needed ios-architect input first
```

---

### Step 5: Initialize Phase State

Create or update phase tracking:

```typescript
// Create .claude/orchestration/phase_state.json
{
  "pipeline": "nextjs",
  "task": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "started": "2025-11-24T18:00:00Z",
  "current_phase": "context_query",
  "phases": {
    "context_query": {
      "status": "completed",
      "timestamp": "2025-11-24T18:00:00Z"
    },
    "planning": { "status": "pending" },
    "implementation": { "status": "pending" },
    "verification": { "status": "pending" },
    "completion": { "status": "pending" }
  },
  "context_bundle_summary": {
    "relevant_files_count": 10,
    "has_design_system": true,
    "past_decisions_count": 5
  },
  "plan_used": "requirements/2025-11-24-1730-add-dark-mode" || null,
  "gates_passed": [],
  "gates_failed": [],
  "artifacts": []
}
```

---

### Step 6: Show Plan & Confirm (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: You MUST output the plan BEFORE asking for confirmation.**

#### 6a: OUTPUT the plan (visible to user)

First, print the execution plan so the user can see it:

```
## Execution Plan

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

**Pipeline:** [detected pipeline]
**Grand Architect:** [agent name]

### Phases:
1. **Context Query** - Load project context from ProjectContextServer
2. **Analysis** - [Architect agent] analyzes scope, risks, affected files
3. **Implementation** - [Builder agent] + specialists implement changes
4. **Gates** - Standards enforcement, design QA
5. **Verification** - Build/test validation

### Files likely affected:
- [list relevant files from ContextBundle]

### Agents that will be involved:
- [grand-architect] (coordination)
- [architect] (planning)
- [builder] (implementation)
- [specialists as needed]

### Risks/Notes:
- [any risks or dependencies identified]
```

#### 6b: THEN ask for confirmation

```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Proceed with this plan?",
    header: "Confirm",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {
        label: "Yes, proceed",
        description: "Execute the plan as shown above"
      },
      {
        label: "Modify approach",
        description: "I want to change something before proceeding"
      }
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Process response:**
- "Yes, proceed" → Continue to Step 7
- "Modify approach" → Ask what to change, update plan, re-confirm

---

### Step 7: Route to Domain Orchestrator (OS 2.3)

**For pipelines with domain-specific `/orca-{domain}` commands, route to them.**

This allows domain orchestrators to handle:
- Complexity classification (simple/medium/complex)
- `-tweak` flag for forcing light path
- Spec gating for complex tasks
- Memory-first context within the domain

#### For Next.js / Webdev:

**Route to `/orca-nextjs`** - handles complexity routing internally.

```typescript
// Simple approach: Use SlashCommand
SlashCommand({ command: `/orca-nextjs ${$ARGUMENTS}` })

// OR if staying in Task tool:
Task({
  subagent_type: "nextjs-grand-architect",
  description: "Next.js pipeline coordination",
  prompt: `
You are the Next.js Grand Architect for OS 2.3.

### Step 8: Monitor & Coordinate

After delegating to grand-architect:

1. **Monitor phase progression** via phase_state.json
2. **Handle interruptions** - If user asks questions mid-execution:
   - Update phase_state with new info
   - Pass updated context to appropriate agent
   - Resume where left off
3. **Enforce gates** - Ensure grand-architect respects quality gates
4. **Track artifacts** - Monitor what's being created

---

### Step 9: Completion & Summary

When grand-architect signals completion:

1. **Verify completion:**
   - Check phase_state.json shows "completed"
   - Verify all gates passed
   - Confirm artifacts created

2. **Save task history:**
   ```typescript
   mcp__project-context__save_task_history({
     domain: "nextjs",
     task: $ARGUMENTS,
     outcome: "success" | "failure" | "partial",
     learnings: "Key takeaways from this task",
     files_modified: ["list", "of", "files"]
   })
   ```

3. **Record agent outcomes (Self-Learning):**

   For each agent that was invoked, record the outcome:
   ```bash
   # Format: workshop decision "[agent]: [task]" -r "[outcome details]" -t agent-outcome -t [agent-name]

   # Example for successful agent:
   workshop --workspace .claude/memory decision "ios-swiftui-specialist: profile screen" \
     -r "Outcome: success. What worked: @Observable pattern, avoided Combine. Time: 30min" \
     -t agent-outcome -t ios-swiftui-specialist

   # Example for partial success:
   workshop --workspace .claude/memory decision "ios-builder: navigation refactor" \
     -r "Outcome: partial. What worked: TabView structure. What failed: Deep linking - needed architect first" \
     -t agent-outcome -t ios-builder

   # Example for failure:
   workshop --workspace .claude/memory decision "nextjs-builder: auth implementation" \
     -r "Outcome: failure. What failed: Tried NextAuth but needed custom JWT. Rule: Check auth requirements with architect first" \
     -t agent-outcome -t nextjs-builder
   ```

   **Key fields to capture:**
   - Agent name
   - Brief task description
   - Outcome (success/partial/failure)
   - What worked (patterns, approaches)
   - What failed (if applicable)
   - Rule/learning (if failure or partial)

4. **Generate summary:**
   ```
   ✅ TASK COMPLETED

   Pipeline: ${pipelineName}
   Grand Architect: ${grandArchitectName}

   Phases Completed:
   - Context Query ✓
   - Planning ✓
   - Implementation ✓
   - Standards Gate ✓ (score: 95)
   - Design QA ✓ (score: 92)
   - Verification ✓

   Files Modified:
   - app/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx
   - app/layout.tsx
   - styles/globals.css

   Decisions Recorded: 3
   Standards Created: 1

   Next Steps:
   - Test dark mode in production
   - Update user documentation
   ```

5. **Clean up:**
   - Archive temp files to .claude/orchestration/evidence/ if needed
   - Mark phase_state.json as "completed"

## Memory Architecture

OS 2.2 uses TWO memory systems:

1. **Workshop** (.claude/memory/workshop.db):
   - Decisions with reasoning
   - Gotchas and warnings (formalized format below)
   - User preferences
   - Task history and learnings
   - **Agent outcomes** (for self-learning)
   - Access: `workshop --workspace .claude/memory <command>`

### Gotcha Format (What Happened / Cost / Rule)

When recording gotchas, use this structured format:
```bash
workshop --workspace .claude/memory gotcha "[What happened - the incident]" \
  -r "Cost: [time wasted, bugs, rework]. Rule: [preventive measure]"
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Technical gotcha
workshop --workspace .claude/memory gotcha "Agent tools as YAML array caused 0 tool uses" \
  -r "Cost: 2 hours debugging silent failures. Rule: Always use comma-separated string for tools"

# Process gotcha
workshop --workspace .claude/memory gotcha "Skipped /plan for 'simple' auth feature" \
  -r "Cost: 4 hours rework when requirements changed. Rule: Use /plan for any auth/security work"

# Architecture gotcha
workshop --workspace .claude/memory gotcha "ios-builder started without ios-architect review" \
  -r "Cost: Navigation refactor needed after deep linking failed. Rule: Architect reviews all navigation changes first"
```

2. **vibe.db** (.claude/memory/vibe.db):
   - Code chunks with embeddings
   - Symbol index (functions, classes)
   - Semantic search vectors
   - Library documentation (via context7)
   - Access: `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/vibe-sync.py <command>`

**ProjectContextServer queries BOTH** and bundles results for agents.

When recording outcomes:
- Decisions → `mcp__project-context__save_decision` (routes to Workshop)
- Task history → `mcp__project-context__save_task_history` (routes to Workshop)
- Standards → `mcp__project-context__save_standard` (routes to Workshop)
- Code indexing → Automatic via vibe.db sync

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)

**❌ NEVER:**
1. Write code directly (you orchestrate only)
2. Query context multiple times (once is enough!)
3. Call intermediate "pipeline orchestrator" agents
4. Skip team confirmation
5. Bypass quality gates
6. Forget to pass ContextBundle to grand-architects
7. Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for domain work

**✅ ALWAYS:**
1. Check for /plan output first
2. Query ProjectContextServer once
3. Call grand-architects directly
4. Pass full ContextBundle to grand-architects
5. Confirm pipeline and team with user
6. Update phase_state.json
7. Record decisions and learnings to Workshop

---

## Begin Execution

Now execute the flow:

1. Detect working directory
2. Check for existing /plan output
3. Detect pipeline type
4. Query ProjectContext ONCE
5. Initialize phase_state.json
6. Confirm with user
7. Delegate to grand-architect with ContextBundle
8. Monitor and coordinate
9. Complete and summarize

Execute for: **$ARGUMENTS**
